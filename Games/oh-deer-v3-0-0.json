    "description": "One Hunter, and up to four more friends disguised as deer. In this thrilling game of hide-and-seek where every move could be the last. Will you blend in with the herd or stand out? Oh Deer… The hunter’s role is to use sound, gadgets, and pure skill to locate and eliminate the other players before nightfall. Capes\nHowever, knowing if the deer in your sights is a player or not is the true challenge. The Deer’s role is to hide from the hunter by blending in with a handful of AI deer scattered around the map. Eating food is a priority to keep hunger at bay. But improper timing when eating could mean the difference between life and death. Forests are the perfect place to hide. With lots of trees, bushes, and cute flowers, deer can live happily for years without any worries. That is, until hunting season begins… Tall trees, thick bushes, and plenty of shade sets up a perfect ambush.",
