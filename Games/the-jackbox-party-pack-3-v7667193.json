    "description": "The threequel to the party game phenomenon features FIVE new sense-shattering games! Quiplash 2 (3-8 players) The say-anything sequel. Play all new questions or make your own! Trivia Murder Party (1-8 players) A deadly quiz show where you match wits with a trivia-obsessed killer. Guesspionage (2-8 players) The brain-battering data-mining guessing game. Tee K.O. (3-8 players) The t-shirt slugfest where you battle your custom t-shirts to the death Fakin’ It (3-6 players) One of your friends has something to hide in this sneaky game for tricksters. Play using your phones, tablets, or computers. No extra controllers needed Indoorlands\nAll games support up to 10,000 audience members playing along Plus tons of just for streamers! It’s a digital box full of actual fun Quiplash 2 is for 3-8 players. As compared to its predecessor, Quiplash 2 introduces new prompts, the ability for the hosting player to create new prompts, the ability for the host to censor players, the “safety quip” feature that incorporates the ability for the player to have a quip written for them, and new “Last Lash” rounds that either requires players to come up with a meaning of a given acronym, complete a caption in a comic strip, or come up with something clever using a given word in a prompt; unlike the previous game’s final round, medals determine the points distributed to the players.\nBy using either their phones, computers or tablets, between two to eight players can take part in the games, with people who are watching (known as “audience members”) can also guess. Guesspionage is for 2-8 players and is a percentage-guessing game. In the first two rounds, each player in turn, guesses what percentage of people have a certain quality or do a certain activity, such as texting while driving. If there are more than 5 audience members, they are surveyed prior to the turns to get these percentages, otherwise earlier survey results by Jackbox Games are used. Once the current player makes their guess, the other active players can consider if they are higher or lower than the guessed value, including opining if they are off by more than a certain amount.\nPoints are scored by the current player based on how close they are and by the other players based on the guessing of higher or lower. The Jackbox Party Pack 7 Points are also scored by the current player that guessed the exact percentage. In the final round, one question with 9 choices is given, and the players all have to pick what they think are the three most popular answers, with points awarded based on the answer’s popularity. The player with the most points at the end wins. Trivia Murder Party is for 1-8 players and has a lighthearted theme of a horror thriller (similar to the Saw franchise). Each round includes a multiple-choice trivia question, with players earning in-game money for being correct, and then a subsequent “ Killing Floor” mini-game if any “living” player got the question wrong. The mini-game may cost the lives of one or more remaining players, who then otherwise continue in the game as ghosts.",
