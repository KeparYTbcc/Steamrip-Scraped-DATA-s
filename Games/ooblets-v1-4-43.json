    "description": "Ooblets is a relaxing yet deeply-weird farming, creature collection, town life, and dance-battle game with a lot of heart and character. It’s a game for people who want something cozy, eccentric, expressive, and full of things to do. Convert your rundown shack into a cozy homestead, spooky sanctuary, retro- futuristic retreat, or just keep it as a rundown shack. There’s plenty of furniture and decor to collect. Vampire: The Masquerade\nFor your character, there are a bunch of hairs, hats, clothes , costumes, accessories, and more throughout the game. Collect ooblet seeds and grow your own lil followbabies on your farm. Each ooblet has a couple variants to nab, including the lauded and rare GLEAMY type. You can also make non-ooblet friends by talking, gift-giving, quest-fetching, and whatnot. Get to know a bunch of offbeat townsfolk, like Mayor Tinstle, Rugnolia, Outgrid, Videon, Millew, and even Taffy .",
