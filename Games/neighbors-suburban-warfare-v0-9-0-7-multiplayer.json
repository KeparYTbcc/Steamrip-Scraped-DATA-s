    "description": "Suburban rivalries erupt into full scale mayhem in a 4v4 battle of home improvement against home destruction. Assemble a team from a cast of unique iconic residents, set up defenses to protect your home and use every imaginable tool to knock out your neighbors and wreck their home before they do the same to you.\nMeet the Neighbors Imagine your ordinary collection of locals, crafty homemakers, bratty kids, grumpy retirees, taking on the combat classes that suit them best. Like Doreen, the kindly granny in her housecoat – and boxing gloves. A retired boxer, she packs a wicked uppercut. Or Kevin, the menace, with his slingshot . Each character brings their unique strengths, and signature super, to help your team win. Manhunt\nAttack Your Neighbor “The best defense is a good offense” holds true in Neighbors . Mostly harmless household items become useful weapons in the fight . Grab a frying pan or golf club and get into the fight. Upgrade to access more creative gadgets, like the Seagull-130 control unit to rain eggs and bird poop down on your enemy from above.",
