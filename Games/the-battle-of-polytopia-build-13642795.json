Obvs Scene: Enter the Square, the bizarre home planet of the Polytopians, a flat square-shaped landmass drifting in the space of an alternate dimension to ours.\nA relatively simple and curious folk that has a penchant for fighting, the Polytopians are 15 individual tribes spread out across the Square, each with their own characteristics, motivations , strengths and weaknesses. As a player, you will take on the role of the ruler of one of these tribes as you attempt to build your civilization in competition with the other tribes.\nWill you choose to be the leader of the Xin-Xi, reserved yet adventurous traditionalists that are wary of change or outsiders ? Perhaps the Hoodrick, who love archery, nature, mushrooms, and famed for their baked goods! Or maybe the Bardur, where the local tavern is their favorite place and Ullefurgh their drink choice, a delightful concoction of pine needles, hot water and rabbit fat.\nDeeeelicious But beware of the Vengir, purple rhino-pig riding warriors who, in between bouts of pillaging , like to sharpen their swords and vacation at the misty Kithkga Boneyards. You really donâ€™t want to get on their bad side",
