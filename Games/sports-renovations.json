    "description": "Your hometown basketball court is in danger – once home to a top-tier league team fostering many new talents in the field, now covered in cobwebs and dust. And now a big developer is only waiting to get his grubby hands on the place, tear it down and build a new shopping mall instead. But you won’t accept that.\nHow do you save the place? Do what you do best! Grab your tools, roll up your sleeves and breathe some life into other old sports facilities to earn money. See the spaces normally unavailable to normal visitors. Learn the inner workings of sports and listen to fascinating tales about their history. And when you’ve earned enough, step up and renovate your hometown’s court for a rewarding endgame .",
