    "description": "Mortal Kombat X’s story mode, and it’s built like the previous games, MK9 and Injustice. You play through chapters, switching between characters for a few fights, which is cool for getting to know everyone. But man, the story’s a bit of a mess. It jumps all over the timeline! We’re talking a couple of years after the last game, then BAM, 25 years in the future, and then everyone’s having flashbacks to stuff that happened five years before that. Plus, some familiar faces have turned into these evil ‘revenants’ working with Quan Chi, and trying to keep track of who’s on what side when is a headache. Honestly, it felt like the ending was rushed , with the new ‘Kombat Kidz’ showing up in the nick of time way too often.\nAnd while the cutscenes look great and flow into the fights smoothly, they threw in these Quick Time Events, which were kind of annoying. Instead of enjoying the story, you’re just staring at the bottom of the screen, waiting to press a button. The characters and their stories are definitely better than the old-school Mortal Kombat games after MK3, but overall, the story was a bit of a letdown.\nNow, the fighting itself? That’s where MKX shines. It builds on the systems from MK9 and Injustice. You’ve got your basic attacks, the three-part super meter, combo breakers, X-ray moves, and EX special moves. They’ve added some cool tweaks, though. You can now EX throws, which cancels them and leaves your opponent open for more attacks. Plus, there’s a block breaker, which pushes enemies back when you’re blocking. The fights feel faster and smoother, and some combos seem a bit easier to land. LEGO MARVEL Super Heroes\nThey’ve also got those interactive backgrounds, which are fun. You can grab stuff and throw it at your opponent. It’s hilarious to toss old ladies or dead bodies at people! They’ve put a meter on using these, so you can’t just spam them. This meter also goes down when you back dash or run, which is new.\nSpeaking of running, I found that a bit awkward. You have to double-tap block after a forward dash to run. If you’re like me and you dash forward and immediately try to block, you end up running instead, leaving yourself wide open. I kept running face-first into attacks because I forgot to double-tap block to stop. It’s probably just me being clumsy, but I thought I’d mention it.\nBasically, Mortal Kombat X has some awesome fighting and fun new mechanics, but the story’s a bit of a confusing mess. If you’re into the fighting, though, you’ll probably have a blast.”",
