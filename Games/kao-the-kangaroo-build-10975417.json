    "description": "Kao The Kangaroo is a 3D platformer from veterans of the genre Tate Multimedia, featuring a plucky, cheeky but a cutie, Kao The Kangaroo (Hey, just like in the title!) on a quest to uncover the truth around the disappearance of his father. PAC-MAN MUSEUM+\nDuring his journey, Kao will explore a wide variety of beautifully detailed environments, each harboring secrets to uncover. At every turn, Kao faces new challenges.\nHe’ll have to use all his skills while learning some new ones not all of them being natural to the world he lives in As they say, it’s the journey that makes us, not the destination. Being inspired by the heyday of 3D platformers, as well as building on Kao’s 21-year legacy\nKao The Kangaroo is packed with plenty of jumping, thumping, puzzle-solving, and collecting. A whole new amazing adventure with all the charm you’d expect from not just the genre, but Kao himself",
