    "description": "The year is 2008.\nCitywide blackouts … stock exchange sabotage … electronic hijacking of national defense systems … this is information warfare.\nTo prevent these attacks, operatives must infiltrate deep into hostile territory and aggressively collect critical intelligence, closer than ever to enemy soldiers.\nYou are Sam Fisher, the NSA’s most elite black-ops agent. To achieve your mission you will kill from close range, attack with your combat knife, shoot with the prototype Land Warrior rifle, and use radical suppression techniques such as the inverted neck break.
