    "description": "Maybe itâ€™s a bedroom. A calm place in the open. Your bathroom . Or maybe your personal computer? During times of need, a programmer developed a virtual cozy experience for his girlfriend . It was a warm, isolated wood cabin on the snowy alps. With a chill-out music playing on the background, a nice place to say for a while if not by a system bug on the basement, showing a hidden path to another world.
