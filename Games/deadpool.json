    "description": "Deadpool is an action-packed video game with a third-person shooter and action hack slash. The gameplay is all about fighting enemies using guns and other melee weapons. The arms and ammunition will become more advanced as you progress through the story and earn points to upgrade. Steep\nAt frequent intervals, the game breaks the fourth wall by allowing Deadpool to have verbal interaction with the player. This of course is based on progress and skill. Deadpool is by default armed with swords and guns. He also has the access to plasma guns, giant hammers, and a variety of other weapons in the game.\nYou will be delighted to know that short teleportation moves are possible as well. When Deadpool falls apart and sustains the damage, the players must be careful to avoid any further damage. This will allow time to recover. Deadpool can eliminate enemies silently with guns, weapons, or stealth kills.",
