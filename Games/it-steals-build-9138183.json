    "description": "IT STEALS is a challenging experiment in survival horror, revolving around stealthy and unpredictable monstrosities. Each game mode is an escalation of that idea, featuring a new formidable evil and unique abilities to face against it. Play by their rules, or suffer their quick wrath. They are always present within the walls of the maze, scheming against you.\nIT STEALS does not tell you everything. In each mode you are given the tools to survive, but itâ€™s on you to learn how to use them correctly. You must infer and improvise; with each death, something is learned, and victory comes a step closer. AROUND EVERY CORNER. The Night is Grey",
