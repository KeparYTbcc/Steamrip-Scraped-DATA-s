I am here to tell you just a little bit more about Phoebe and her latest invention: Floppy Knights Who is Phoebe, you ask? She is a talented inventor with a mission: save up enough cash to finally move out of her parents’ place. There are plenty of odd jobs all over town but only one Phoebe and that is where the Floppy Knights come in There are a bunch of Floppy Knights you can pick from to determine your own style. Out There: Oceans of Time\nIt will be up to you to mix and match snazzy card combos to make a winning strategy. A fresh take on two familiar genres! Lead your Knights to victory across the battlefield using decks you have crafted with care.
