    "title": "The Wandering Village",
    "description": "In a world where mysterious plants are spreading all over the earth, emitting toxic spores as they grow, a small group of survivors seeks shelter on the back of a giant, wandering creature they call ‘Onbu’. Become their leader, build their settlement and form a symbiotic relationship with Onbu to survive together in this hostile, yet beautiful post-apocalyptic world. A functioning village is the basis of your survival .\nBuild your settlement and expand it over Onbu’s back. Plan production chains and optimise them to utilise the limited space as efficiently as possible. Create a society that can overcome any challenge. Living on the back of another organism comes with its own set of challenges. Will you live in symbiosis, bond with Onbu and survive on mutual trust? Or will you become a parasite, only aiming to ensure a better life for your villagers ? The choice is yours. Food Truck Simulator\nContinuously adapt your village as you travel through a multitude of different biomes, each with its unique climate zones, opportunities and threats. Scout your environments and send out foraging missions to gather rare resources and ancient artefacts. Remnants of the old world hold knowledge that has long been forgotten, but can be unearthed by your villagers. Find and research these technologies, but use them wisely, as progress can be a double-edged sword. Ensure the survival of both your villagers and your Onbu, even though poisonous spores, merciless weather, bloodsucking parasites and many more challenges mean that the odds are often stacked against you.",
