    "description": "Your objective is to find the impostor doll, which will play with you to avoid being caught. Perform the following steps: Supernatural\nThe dolls have their own objectives, preferences, friendships, enmities, loves, and hatreds towards circumstances , events, or other dolls. Traps will help you catch conservative dolls; perhaps tempting them by turning on music or a television will make them react, allowing you to better interpret their tastes and appreciations .\nDo not trust their actions; these dolls are much smarter than you think. They are capable of moving others from their place and annihilating other dolls in order to confuse you, especially if you do not know each doll well. You might assume that everything is over if you find a single doll out of its box. However, it may not have moved on its own; another doll might have moved it, or even moved many others while it remains completely still.",
