Unless your friends can cross a broken America, retrieve your identifying documents and stay out of trouble this is the end of the American dream for you.\nIn an alternative broken America, where capitalism and political greed have taken center stage, your friend has gone missing. Snatched during a protest, Eduardo Suarez has been seized by the authorities, and now sits ready for processing in the Miami gulag.\nNot Tonight 2 is an American document-checking road trip, fusing a time-pressure RPG with a politically charged, dark comedy where every decision matters.
