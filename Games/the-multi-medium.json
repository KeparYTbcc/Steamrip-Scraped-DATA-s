The world is watching as you embark on a first-of-its-kind expedition to explore parallel universes , but something goes wrong there is a glitch in the technology and you canâ€™t get back home. Lost in the multiverse, you embark on a journey to find your place in each world and in the cosmos .\nJump, climb, swing, swim, toss, and grapple your way through 10 diverse universes, each with its own distinct art style, setting, and story. Each level of the game is painted or drawn in a different physical medium, scanned, then brought to life in the game. Absolutely no digital art was used in the making of the game. Osiris: New Dawn",
