    "description": "The life of a Cat Cafe Manager awaits Your grandmother left you a small cafe in the sleepy village of Caterwaul Way, and it’s up to you to fix the place up, impress the locals, and befriend the local cat population. Time to roll up your sleeves, break out the tools, and start hammering away. Your cat cafe can be the talk of the town with the right attitude, menu, and of course, the right cats.\nThat’s right, Caterwaul Way is home to a plethora of extraordinary felines. The cafe can become their home, to the delight and relief of the villagers. Who knows, maybe their presence will loosen tongues and help you discover the secrets of Caterwaul Way cats and take them off the streets , giving them a home.\nThe cafe is run-down and abandoned by the time you arrive, but it’s nothing that a little bit of elbow grease (and money) can’t fix. Renovate the cafe, then decorate and expand it as you see fit and create a welcoming place for cats – and people to relax in Build up a capable staff by hiring the right people, managing their workload, and helping them refine their skills. Refine your cafe experience further with custom dishes and other menu items, catering to your customer’s needs. ABRISS – build to destroy\nA good cafe is more than just a restaurant with good food and drinks. The difference lies in relationships. At Caterwaul Way, that means befriending cats and townsfolk alike. Befriend and build relationships with a diverse cast of local villagers , such as Finley, a young musician trying to make it big, or Bonner, the local ferryman who’s got some very tall stories to tell.",
