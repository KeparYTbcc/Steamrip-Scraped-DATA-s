Your death is guaranteed, but so is your status as a legend. BLEACH Rebirth of Souls\nThe ever-shifting abyss provides an adequate challenge to fearless dungeoneers, but don’t get too reckless as you only have one life to prove yourself with. Central to this plight is the dynamic of holding your position and pushing ever forward as hoards of monsters try to break your foothold; they are quite numerous afterall, and you’d do well to stand your ground. Don’t stall for too long however, or a terrifying force might make itself known and attempt to steal your glory!",
