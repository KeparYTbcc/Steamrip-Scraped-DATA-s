    "description": "STANDBOX is about that urge that you might have had as a kid, when you were more interested about the tech-demo than the game advertised. Stray Gods: The Roleplaying Musical Itâ€™s an interactive sandbox where you get to bully a smart ragdoll. He can stand, tries to balance himself up, fall and get back-up, and is animated by an approximation of a medical system that includes organs . You can damage him or play with him, throw him around and more.",
