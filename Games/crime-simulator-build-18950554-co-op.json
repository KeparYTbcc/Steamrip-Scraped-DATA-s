    "description": "You landed in jail, but a mysterious benefactor bailed you out. Now they want their money back – and fast. Your only chance is to do what you do best: commit crimes. Break into houses, steal valuables, and complete dangerous jobs alone or with up to three friends. Can you pay off your debt before the deadline passes?\nExplore three distinct areas – each filled with unique targets, security setups, and plenty of loot. Whether you’re sneaking through high-tech mansions or brawling in shady neighborhoods, every location offers new challenges and hidden rewards.\nGo it alone or team up with friends in 4-player co-op . Coordinate break-ins, split the loot, and watch each other’s backs – or pull a double-cross if you’re feeling bold. The choice is yours.\nEvery great heist starts with the right gear. Lockpicks let you slip through locked doors like a ghost, while a crossbow silently takes out guards or disables cameras. If you prefer a more hands-off approach, pump sleeping gas through air vents and watch an entire building go down without a sound. But sometimes, subtlety isn’t an option – when things get messy, a trusty baseball bat can solve a lot of problems.\nAnd that’s just the beginning. The full game takes your toolkit to the next level with high-tech gadgets like drones for scouting, zip ties to keep troublemakers out of the way, and scanners to track down the most valuable loot. Adapt, improvise, and own every job your way.\nThe clock is always ticking, and your debt isn’t getting any smaller. Every job brings you closer to paying it off, but fail to meet your quota in time, you’ll lose everything. Plan your heists carefully, use your tools wisely, and take advantage of every opportunity. Need an edge? Buy insider tips online to uncover the best targets, scout security weaknesses, or find high-value loot.\nThe job seems too risky to play alone? Call in a backup – team up with friends in co-op and make sure you get the payout before it’s too late.",
