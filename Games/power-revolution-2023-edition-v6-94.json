    "description": "As 2023 begins, the war in the Ukraine is inflaming the planet. Other than the risk of military escalation in this conflict, the effects can also be geopolitical, first of all, with a clash of ideologies between the democratic model and the authoritarian model, and secondly, economic, with inflation remaining very high throughout the world, leading to a reduction of purchasing power and an increase in social inequality.\nNevertheless, every nation in the world agrees: the war must end as soon as possible! But between the Ukraine preparing their counteroffensive and Russia trying to retain the regions they annexed , the situation seems interminable. HOT WHEELS UNLEASHED 2 – Turbocharged\nFor an even more detailed simulation of this conflict, several wargame features have been added: digging trenches, building “dragon’s teeth” type barriers or bunkers, incorporating artillery by the use of mortar rounds, laying down minefields, simulating troop morale which influences combat effectiveness and the risk of desertions, the possibility of moving troops stealthily, the use of suicide drones, partial mobilization, budgeting for the training and equipping of infantrymen , hiring a private paramilitary group, high velocity missiles, creation of an international military base, etc.\nThe “ Ukrainian Counteroffensive ” scenario allows you to play as the Ukraine just as they launch their attack with up to date data: front lines, troop strength, detailed weaponry, especially those promised by Western powers… Your objective is to recover as much of your territory as you can to be able to negotiate peace accords from a position of strength, all while being very mindful about the possibility of nuclear weapons .\nAfter years of COVID, immigration is once again growing substantially throughout the world, a result of the harmful effects of global warming and economic consequences in poor countries from the rising costs of energy and food. The 2023 Edition expands the migration engine by integrating detailed information on immigration flow for all countries, entering and leaving (illegal immigration, economic, students, humanitarian, familial) and by offering new tools for migratory policy: regulating jus solis, family unification, naturalization , regularization of illegals; construction of detention centers and border walls; agreements with countries of origin on the issuing of visas, reinforcing borders, detention of migrants in transit, facilitating the deportation of illegal immigrants; entering and leaving the Schengen Area… The new scenario on reducing illegal immigration will demonstrate how the implementation of these actions will play out.",
