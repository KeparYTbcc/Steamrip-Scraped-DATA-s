    "description": "A Hostile Interpretation Of Immersive Sim Design This game is a response to the current trend of Immersive Sim design, where every ability is perfectly suited to solve a specific problem in the game. In order to counter this “Lock and Key” philosophy , Mosa Lina is aggressively random.\nIt’s literally impossible for me to check if all levels are beatable with all combinations of tools. This is what makes it so satisfying: There is no premeditated solution for you to follow. You’re forced to get creative.\nThe game continually spits out randomised problems. It’s up to YOU to solve them, because I’ve never seen them before.",
