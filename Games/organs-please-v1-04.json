    "description": "Earth’s population is on the verge of a global resource crisis. Can you build the spaceship on time and earn one more chance for humankind? Hurry, you only have only 30 days left Screen the visitors dying to get off the planet and more than willing to risk being turned into canned food, incinerated or hired as one of the factory’s employees. Nobody – The Turnaround\nThe pros and cons of each fate are debatable. Manage the factory floor, construct new facilities and upgrade the research center. Resources are finite, so try to make sure things don’t fall apart before the ship takes off. Hire staff with unique quirks, fears and prejudices. Promote hard workers and keep them pampered with improved amenities . As for the lazy ones they get sent to a special room in the darkest corner of the factory.",
