    "description": "Supraland Six Inches Under game for free instantly and play pre-installed on SteamRiP\n“ Six Inches Under” was a little side project that was established to introduce new dev team members to our tools and workflow. Essentially it’s our preparation for the sequel to Supraland. While David Münnich made the first Supraland game pretty much alone, he had a smaller role in this one.\nThe core team for this one had 6 people. Pretty much everyone on team built 1 or 2 regions of the game world and in that sense it is very experimental. It was supposed to be a little DLC for Supraland , but it got a bit out of hand and got more and more ambitous .\nInstead of 3 months it took us 27 months to make this (Supraland 1 was in development for 16 months). It can be considered “Supraland 1.5” because there are still a lot things from the first game, but at the same time it’s a new world with a bunch of new mechanics. Farm Together",
