    "description": "The late-’90s landmark visual novel from AQUAPLUS is back and fully remastered\nStrolling down a street paved with pastel tiles, the sun warms my back as pigeons flock by the roadside. Amid this everyday scenery, it’s another ordinary morning, with just a soft whisper of spring on the wind.\n“It’s a little warmer again today, huh?” Akari pipes up as she turns her eyes to me, her bangs swaying gently in the breeze. “I guess winter’s over.” CityDriver\n“I guess it is,” I answer offhandedly, and Akari giggles. I don’t know why.\nToHeart is a “heartful,” heartfelt , and comedic multiple-ending visual novel. The protagonist is an utterly ordinary young man, but his friends Akari, Masashi, and Shiho make every day a happy one.\nAs winter turns to spring and March turns to April, the wind also carries a whisper of love.",
