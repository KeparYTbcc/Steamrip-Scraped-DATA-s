    "description": "Rhythm Doctor is a rhythm game in a world where defibrillating patients’ hearts in sync with their heartbeats has healing properties. Slam your spacebar in perfect time on the 7th beat, and they might just come out okay. But beware – every patient has unique illnesses based on complex music theory: polyrhythms , hemiolas, irregular time signatures if you don’t know what they mean, don’t worry. Rhythm Doctor is designed to make you learn music and rhythm theory without even realising it\n(Note: 2P mode only works locally. Online 2P via Remote Play is enabled for this game, but it does not work that well right now due to varying latency )",
