    "description": "The SCP Foundation has gone dark. Disturbing intel from one of the many Foundation sites, Area-12, a biological research and specialized containment facility deep underground in West Virginia, has been forwarded to the FBI, who send operatives from their anomalous branch, the UIU (Unusual Incidents Unit) to investigate before initiating the Faultline Protocol. Carry The Glass\nUpon arrival the UIU are ambushed and trapped within Area-12 by a facility wide lock-down, leaving you alone and without backup. For reasons yet unclear, Area-12 has adopted a new agenda creating weaponized hybrids of anomalies at this facility, and now the UIU must get to the bottom of “why” and stop them before these monstrosities are unleashed on innocent civilians .",
