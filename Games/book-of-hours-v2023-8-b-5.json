    "description": "For fifteen centuries, Hush House was a fortress of knowledge . Until the fire. The collection is ruined, and the last Librarian is gone. Only one with your unique talents can rebuild the library, and uncover its mysteries.\nEnjoy the sweet peace of organising books and customising your new home, all while unpeeling centuries of history from the occult stones around you. As the newest Librarian , you’ve chosen solitude but your influence extends far beyond the walls of Hush House. It’s up to you to determine how history is written. BOOK OF HOURS is an elegant, melancholy, combat -free crafting RPG set in an occult library, from the creator of Fallen London, Sunless Sea and the double BAFTA-nominated Cultist Simulator. En Garde!\nWeather Factory is a two-person dev team supported by many brilliant freelancers. BOOK OF HOURS was partially funded by the European Union’s Creative Europe Programme – MEDIA . Thank you, Europe! We love you.",
