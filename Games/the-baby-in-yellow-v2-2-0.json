    "description": "The Baby In Yellow is a Lovecraftian comedy horror game where you must look after a suspicious baby and survive his attempts to take control. Over the course of 8 chapters this creepy bundle of madness must be well-fed, clean and most importantly, kept entertained. This may not be your first babysitting job, but it could be your last. So listen to that whisper in your head, the one that tells you to obey, and everything will be fine.\nOriginally created in 48 hours for a game jam and inspired by the book of short stories ‘The King in Yellow’ by Robert Chambers , The Baby in Yellow has been downloaded over 140 million times on mobile and videos of its gameplay have gained millions of views on social media.
