    "description": "Mutants and humans have been kickin’ it together in New York City. But then, Leonardo , Raphael, Michelangelo, and Donatello discovered several shipments of mutagenic ooze were scattered, contaminating areas of the City.\nIt didn’t seem so bad until they realised new mutants, a.k.a. ‘ Mewbies ‘, spawned from this mess. Not all these Mewbies are evil, but some have lost their way, and the citizens don’t feel safe anymore.\nJoin the legendary Turtle brothers straight from the sewer and slide into this new adventure of shell-shocking proportions. A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead\nHelp the citizens, find the mewbies, deliver pizzas, and build your graffiti collection.\nWith the help of April’s insightful reports from the streets and Splinter’s sage guidance, gear up to fight crime and unravel an epic saga of justice and chaos",
