    "description": "We present an RPG set up in a medieval fantasy world inspired by those cultures – Anglo-Saxon and Celtic – who were explored by J.R.R. Tolkien as well. Play as Wigmund, a young warrior tasked with the disinterring of the New Regime’s dark secrets. Travel an open-world, rich with outlaw camps, ruined castles, dangerous caverns and forgotten ruins to explore. As in any respectable fantasy story, the dragons will have a special place in the quests. To understand and follow the narrative of the game is crucial for solving these quests. Nightmare Reaper",
