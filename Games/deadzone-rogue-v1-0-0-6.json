    "title": "Deadzone: Rogue",
    "description": "You awaken aboard the ISS-X, with no memory of who you are. There’s a legion of rogue machines, and they’re closing in fast. Fight through swarms of enemies, loot rare gear, and arm yourself with augments to survive. Can you conquer the Deadzone? The Royal Writ\nFight against massive, biomechanical bosses that demand steady aim and quick reflexes. Annihilate waves of hunter-drones, robotic spiders, the mindless, and dozens of other enemies to survive each run. Battle through each ship sector — from the engine rooms to the brig.\nMaster over 30 powerful weapons, each modifiable with elemental affixes and upgrades. Turn a shotgun into a void-spreading crowd crusher, or a submachine gun into a room clearing hail of ice. From plasma cannons to sniper rifles, your arsenal adapts to any combat scenario.\nIncinerate drones with fire, freeze swarms with ice, chain lightning enemies with shock, or send them to the void with a well-timed headshot .",
