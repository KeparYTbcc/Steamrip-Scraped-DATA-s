Before long, Clive will be caught up in a great tragedy and swear revenge on the Dark Eikon Ifrit, a mysterious entity that brings calamity in its wake.\nTitanic Clashes – When rival Dominants come head to head, epic battles between their Eikons ensue !\nEikonic Action – Clive utilizes the powers of multiple Eikons in breakneck battle!\nFrom Strength to Strength A plethora of powerful swordplay techniques and Eikonic abilities lie within Clive’s remit—and it is up to you to decide which ones you wish to learn or upgrade.
