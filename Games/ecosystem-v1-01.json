    "description": "Ecosystem is a game about life. At its heart are evolving virtual lifeforms, who grow from synthetic DNA and live in a physically-simulated ocean. This DNA encodes everything about a creature: their skeletal structure, their mental processors and even their combat prowess. Ratten Reich\nSimulation\nThe nervous system of a virtual lifeform is a pipeline computer where, every moment, data from sense organs passes through a network of neurons and finally contracts a muscle in a specific body part. Creatures swim just like real sea-life, applying torque at their joints to push against the water in a way coordinated to propel themselves forward.\nEvolution\nTo create life, you need only release a batch of these lifeforms into the water with random brains and bodies. Most will flail around aimlessly, but those that manage to move even slightly will get to have more offspring than the others. Ten generations later, their descendants will be talented swimmers.\nItâ€™s really satisfying to see the creatures evolve in a real sense, guided by your hand in the simulated fluid of your own world.",
