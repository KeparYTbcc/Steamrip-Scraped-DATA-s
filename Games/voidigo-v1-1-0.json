Equip one of the many ranged weapons and fight back the corruption. Or use one of the melee weapons if you prefer a more personal approach. Dodge attacks and stomp your enemies to gain the upper hand. The many bosses of Voidigo will put up a good fight, relentlessly fueled by the void’s corruption. OUTRIDERS\nDuring the fight the boss might flee the area, leaving you to decide whether to hunt them, or gather your strength. But don’t linger too long or they will start hunting you. To help you on your fight, find a wide array of powerups for fun synergies. When between worlds, trade your weapons, powerups and other resources. To fully tailor your playstyle.",
