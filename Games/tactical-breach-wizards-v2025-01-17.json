It could work beautifully, fail spectacularly, or screw up in a way that gives you new ideas. Either way, free rewinds mean you play it out in-game instead of scratching your head.\nUpgrade your magical arsenal Every ability for every wizard has a set of unique perks to unlock as they level up, tailoring their powers to your playstyle, and enabling ridiculous ways they can combo with each other.",
