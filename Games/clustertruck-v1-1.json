    "description": "Clustertruck is a new kind of platformer on-top of a speeding highway Use agility and acrobatics through insane levels in a game of “the floor is lava” on top of unpredictable, speeding trucks The game only gets harder when dangers such as swinging hammers , lasers and flamethrowers are added There are only a hundred levels on which you will have to test your sharpness, dexterity, and trivial foresight.\nThe essence of the game is as follows – you get to the level and start running across the roofs of trucks to the finish line. Difficulties begin when you find yourself on such an unusual obstacle course. At first, trucks move along the road at a normal pace, without violating traffic rules, but then the drivers seem to go crazy and chaos begins – trucks start crashing into each other, trucks collide, take off to the side of the road, some fall from bridges and explode, others overturn",
