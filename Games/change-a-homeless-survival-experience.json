    "title": "CHANGE: A Homeless Survival Experience",
    "description": "CHANGE is an emotional homeless survival experience set in a randomly generated city with rogue-like elements. Explore, survive, earn perks, find items and kindness to develop your character and escape to a new life. With hundreds of perks, items, events and more, this serious game comes with a large amount of depth that opens up the more you play, and changes based on how you play. Heartbound\nThis is a hate letter to the growing indifference in the world. When members of the development team almost fell into homelessness some years ago, it inspired us to create something that gives a voice to the forgotten and the vulnerable. We take the subject very seriously and portray it as such. After over 7 years of research and hard work, 100s of updates and fan support, we bring you our tale of survival and isolation .",
