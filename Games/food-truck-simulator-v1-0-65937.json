    "description": "Your father owned a food truck. Though the vehicle has grown old, it has become a cornerstone of your family’s legacy. Now, in the blink of an eye, your father’s gone. Now, the food truck belongs to you. Will you walk in your father’s footsteps and live up to his name? Only one way to find out  You can’t take the ‘truck’ out of ‘food truck’. Before you can set your stalls up, you have to actually get from your garage to wherever you decide to vend for the day. Be mindful of traffic, and congestions too Isonzo\nWhen you feel you’re short on time do as your father did and veer off the beaten path. First come, first served You might’ve thought that all there is to this business is fast food, but now that you’re on the other side of the counter it’s time to think again. Even so much as a slice of cheese can turn a classic burger into a cheeseburger special. So, what will it be, sir? Ketchup or mustard ?",
