    "description": "Ride the elevator up through many unique floors and meet its monstrous inhabitants. You just want to get to your room. But a great storm is lighting up on the horizon, and it wants you. Over 10 unique monsters, big and small, each with their own personalities. You wonâ€™t always be attacked outright; each enemy approaches you with its own mysterious intentions and strategies. Explore bizarre places such as a glass pane factory, an aquarium, an abandoned shopping mall, and a wild west town. Your defining traits are hopping and chucking furniture. You get to chuck furniture at birds. You get to chuck birds at birds.\nMeet Ik, the founder of the Upturned Inn, and together unravel a cosmic horror as it comes to pass. Nothing is what it seems, and every soul is in danger. Your dialogue with Ik may mean the difference between life and death. In Stars and Time",
