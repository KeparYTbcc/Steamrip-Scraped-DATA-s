    "description": "The game is set to fill the gap between The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings. It is a story of revenge, slaughter, and mystery set entirely in Mordor, the Land of Shadows. At its center is Talion, an ordinary man who loses everything, including his mortal life. Possessed by an immensely powerful wraith, Talion becomes a revenant, rising from the grave to avenge the murder of his family. Meanwhile, the wraith inside him, Celebrimbor, struggles to remember his forgotten past, which will allow him to increase in power .\nThe game introduces the Nemesis System, which allows the artificial intelligence of non-playable characters to remember their prior actions against the game’s protagonist and react accordingly. Every enemy in the game has their own name, rank, and memory. These enemies will continue to do their own jobs and tasks even when they’re off screen; the game progresses in real time even if you do not interfere, and as such an enemy you meet in one gameplay session may suddenly have achieved a higher rank the next time you meet him.",
