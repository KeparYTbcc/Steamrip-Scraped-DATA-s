Participate in racing championships , repair arriving cars, navigate challenges like shifting platforms and Dominion Torrento, and secure your victory. A fun and chaotic adventure spanning four decades, from the 70s to the 00s, awaits you. Right and Down\nBuild your Crew Build your pit crew with up to 4 members, assign tasks, and execute clean repairs to double your points and win championships. Teamwork is the key to your success! As a party game, we highly recommend playing it with your family and friends to unlock maximum mayhem . While enjoying it solo might seem less stressful, rest assured, chaos will still be your constant companion.\nFix Cars Your task is to get your driver back on track as quickly as possible. With this in mind, you’ll need to diagnose car issues, make efficient repairs using a variety of tools, and navigate dynamic, hazard-filled pit lanes. Aim for Gold in the championships and give a slap to annoying Dominion Torrento. Also, don’t forget to slap your comrades for proper motivation too.",
