Far off in the distance, a castle can be seen. Perhaps this castle has answers? The journey will be treacherous, but what else can he do? Wrench\nControl Jeremy in order to race through time based levels and reach the end of the level before Jeremy loses his sanity.

Reach the goal in a timely manner and collect all the medallions in a given stage to receive the best rank which awards more Skill Points to improve Jeremy’s stats even further.",
