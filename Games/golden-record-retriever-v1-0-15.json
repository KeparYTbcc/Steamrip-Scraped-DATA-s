    "description": "Golden Record Retriever (GRR) introduces dice instead of cards to the roguelike deck- building genre, creating a new genre of Roguelike Dice Building . Collect and upgrade unique dice that contribute to your team in their own way, and grow from victim to conqueror of luck and chance Misao: Definitive Edition\nOn Earth, a golden retriever named River had an owner named “Paul”.  An inventor , Paul’s fascination with space and aliens led him to spend his life savings on building a spaceship. Soon, the ship is off into space, loaded with golden records of friendly greetings. Shortly thereafter, Paul falls ill and dies. Lonely and alone in the empty house, River one day receives unexpected visitors who say, Each time, River is given a new mission and destination, and he must overcome a series of challenges as he builds his team to complete the journey.\nHowever, the situations he faces are far from typical combat. Instead, they’re more like puzzles that require thought and deliberation. You’ll need to place colored orbs called “ auras ” on the board to use Action Cards to resolve the situation. It’s your teammates that create these auras, and it’s up to you to place your teammates in the right places to solve the puzzle.\nAlmost every teammate has the skill to create auras. But they don’t always do what you want them to do, because skills are represented by dice sides and abilities. If you want a blue aura and roll a die that shows blue on three of the 6 sides and red on the other three, you have a 50% chance of getting your wish.",
