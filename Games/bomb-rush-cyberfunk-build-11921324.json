    "description": "Team Reptile brings you Bomb Rush Cyberfunk , a future world from the mind of Dion Koster where self-styled graffiti crews equipped with personal boostpacks are battling each other for control of the streets. Start your own cypher and dance, paint graffiti, collect beats, combo your tricks and face off with the cops to stake your claim to the sprawling metropolis of New Amsterdam. Red is a graffiti writer who lost his head and instead uses a cyberhead to get around. In search of his roots he joins the Bomb Rush Crew, Tryce and Bel. Cantata\nTogether they decide to go All City, to become the best graffiti crew in the city. The more territory they gain, the more they discover who it was that cut off Redâ€™s head and how deep his human side is linked to the graffiti world.",
