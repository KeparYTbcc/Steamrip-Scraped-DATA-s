    "description": "1 Trait Escape is pushing the 1 Trait Danger universe to new heights. Stoney and Trait have been booked to fly to London but mistakenly board a rocket ship where they crash-land on Mars. But this is no normal Mars. This Mars has been terraformed and colonized by a trillionaire antagonist with a vision to restart feudalism on a new planet to be a true king. When Trait and Stoney land they find themselves in what seems to be a medieval version of London. You will play as Stoney and Trait to survive and escape back to planet Earth.\nAs a rogue -lite, the player will continue to amass power on each run to push themselves closer to their final goal of escaping back to earth. You can expect many intense PvE battles with feudalistic Martian mobs and bosses with many minigames sprinkled in-between. Tobacco Shop Simulator\nBE WARNED: 1 Trait Danger studios makes games that are VERY HARD. 1 Trait Escape is no exception!",
