    "description": "An angst-ridden teenager’s innocent mistake becomes a race against time that could change the course of history. Against the backdrop of a mysterious island inhabited by strange characters, our protagonist must undo her mistake to save everyone. You wake up on an unfamiliar island that is fantastical as it is unsettling, only to realize that you are now responsible for the lives of every one of its denizens .\nThe denizens themselves vary in temperament as much as their looks, and your only hope of saving them is to interact at your own risk The journey is as much about one’s own past and self-discovery as it is about handling the present. With more knowledge gained the stakes are raised higher and the depths you must explore increases in both breadth and complexity. Infernax",
