    "description": "There is a mysterious tower in this world that replicates all sorts of objects from other realities, creating an indefinite space full to the brim with monsters, strange creatures, people, and loot. You have found yourself in this reality, and now it’s your path. Wild West Dynasty\nEntering the tower , you find yourself in fierce battles that require valuable loot items – armor, magic rings, weapons, and much more. These are essential tools for developing your unique builds while clearing the tower’s floors.\nDefeat enemies and earn gold, which can be spent on new loot items. Continuously manage your loot to become stronger right in the battle by absorbing the mythical power of the items you discard – even if for a mere moment, but with dedication it’s enough to ascend to near godhood and kill whatever twisted creature stands in your way.\nLoot in Megaloot serves dual purposes: it can be equipped to enhance the player’s character or consumed during battle for immediate stat boosts. After clearing each floor, you have the option to dismantle loot for permanent stat gains, adding layers of strategic depth to the gameplay.",
