    "description": "VA-11 HALL-A: Cyberpunk Bartender Action is a booze em’ up about waifus, technology, and post-dystopia life.\nIn this world, corporations reign supreme, all human life is infected with nanomachines designed to oppress them, and the terrifying White Knights ensure that everyone obeys the laws.\nBut, this is not about those people.\nYou are a bartender at VA-11 HALL-A, affectionately nicknamed “Valhalla.” Although it is just a small bar downtown, it attracts the most fascinating people this side of dystopia. Keep your clients lubricated and you will be made privy to the most interesting stories.\n“Although there aren’t dialogue options, VA-11 HALL-A creates a storytelling experience that’s grippingly personal. If, like many game theorists argue, story should always act as a supporter to mechanics, then VA-11 HALL-A is the exception that makes the rule.” – Kill Screen\n“Never falls into the trap of simply alternating “gameplay” and “story” as so many narrative-based games do; rather, everything you do feels relevant to what is unfolding in front of you.” – Moe Gamer\n“It’s through these brief, unguarded conversations that the cyberpunk bartending sim slowly unfolds its story; not of a dystopian world, but of the people living in it.” – PC Gamer Tom Clancy’s Splinter Cell Chaos",
