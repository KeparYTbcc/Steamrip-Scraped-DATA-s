    "description": "“Dude, Stop” is a puzzle game, where the main goal is to not follow the rules and make everybody hate you. Break it, abuse it, skip the tutorial, ignore tips and tricks in the loading menu and – most importantly – mute the narrator. For example, stop reading this paragraph and skip to the next one. You’re still reading. Still looking here. And done. You’ve broken your first rule and annoyed us a little bit. And didn’t even buy the game yet Wow, you’re talented. Have you considered quitting your job and doing this fulltime? Collect all rewards, unlock all achievements and brag to your buddies that you’ve enraged some poor developer from a video game and made him scream at you just like in the trailer. Do your best. Or worst. Or both at once. Mago",
