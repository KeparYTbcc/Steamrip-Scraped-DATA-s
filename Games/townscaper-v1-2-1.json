    "description": "Get Townscaper for free instantly and play pre-installed on SteamRiP all indie with latest updates\nBuild quaint island towns with curvy streets. Build small hamlets, soaring cathedrals, canal networks, or sky cities on stilts. Block by block. No goal. No real gameplay . Just plenty of building and plenty of beauty. That’s it. Townscaper is an experimental passion project. More of a toy than a game.\nPick colors from the palette , plop down colored blocks of house on the irregular grid, and watch Townscaper’s underlying algorithm automatically turn those blocks into cute little houses , arches, stairways, bridges and lush backyards, depending on their configuration .",
