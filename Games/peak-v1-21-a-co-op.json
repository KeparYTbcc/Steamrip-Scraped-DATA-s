    "description": "PEAK is a co-op climbing game where the slightest mistake can spell your doom. Either solo or as a group of lost nature scouts, your only hope of rescue from a mysterious island is to scale the mountain at its center. Do you have what it takes to reach the PEAK? Need a Hand? You’ll need to rely on your friends to have any hope of scaling the mountain, which changes each time you play. Help each other up ledges, or place ropes and climbing spikes to make the way easier for those who come after.\nThe Mountain Takes no Prisoners! Climb through 4 biomes on your way to the PEAK, each with their own life-threatening obstacles. You’ll need to scavenge for questionable food to survive, and manage your injuries carefully – every setback limits your stamina, making it harder to climb. the Worst: Discover a variety of helpful survival items, from energy drinks to climbing spikes to the mysterious Anti-Rope. You’ve got no hope of making it to the PEAK unless you press every advantage given to you. Cast n Chill\nThe game’s map rotates out every 24 hours! Try out the new layout each day, or give the same island multiple attempts in a day until you conquer it. A Well-Seasoned Scout: Show off your survival prowess with dozens of badges to earn and cosmetics to unlock. Multiplayer in PEAK is friends-only – invite up to three other scouts through Steam to climb together, or face the mountain alone if you’re really brave!",
