    "description": "Get NARUTO SHIPPUDEN UNS4 PC game for free instantly and play pre-installed on SteamRiP\nThe latest opus in the acclaimed STORM series is taking you on a colorful and breathtaking ride. Take advantage of the totally revamped battle system and prepare to dive into the most epic fights you’ve ever seen in the NARUTO SHIPPUDEN: Ultimate Ninja STORM series Returning to this game from previous instalments is the “Wall Running” feature where two shinobi are able to fight while climbing the walls of the selected stage. Unlike previous instalments however, where if one player ran up the wall the other player was forced to fight on the wall as well, in this game it is implied that if one character runs up the wall the other character can still fight on the ground.\nA new feature was introduced in the game called “Leader Swap”, where you can switch out the main on-point character you’re fighting as to fight against your opponent with your support characters, which can be cancelled into and out of a large majority of various actions. To add balance, the character switched in will share the same life bar as the main character, as well as still maintaining an Awakening state.\nAs a result of the new feature, support only characters from previous entries in the series have been omitted, albeit Leader Swaps can easily disengage attacks landed on the user which can invalidate offence further if used correctly (essentially allowing skilled users to maintain both offence and defense simultaneously). A new version of Naruto and Sasuke will share a unique Combination Awakening when played together.\nThe option to select one of the three fighting types from Storm Revolution (Ultimate, Awakening, and Drive) is removed. Just like its other predecessors, the player can use all three types at once during a single and/or team battle Before starting a battle, you are able to choose between multiple jutsus and Ultimate Jutsus to use in battle, a feature that has been in previous entries of the Ultimate Ninja series, but now makes its return.",
