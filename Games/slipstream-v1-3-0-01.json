    "description": "Slipstream is a racing game inspired by the visuals, music, games and cars from the late 80s and early 90s. Itâ€™s built on a custom game engine, with an authentic retro feel and unique graphics. The soundtrack, drawing from synthpop and jazz fusion influences, sets the tone for a race across a variety of exotic locations from all around the world, including cities, deserts, forests, mountains and beaches. Drifting and slipstreaming mechanics add depth to the driving gameplay, and the result is a challenging and exciting experience. My Friendly Neighborhood",
