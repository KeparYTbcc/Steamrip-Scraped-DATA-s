    "title": "First Cut: Samurai Duel",
    "description": "A high-intensity arcade sword- fighting game where every strike is lethal. Slash, clash, parry, dodge and watch limbs fly in the atmosphere of historical feudal Japan. Choose your move carefully – the first cut is also the last.\nA refined and intuitive fighting system – Aim your sword to block attacks and strike around your opponent’s guard. Parry their attacks with your own, dodge to close the distance, and interrupt them with a well-timed shove. It takes a minute to learn, and a lifetime to master. The Cub\nCustomize your fighter – An array of different options to wear . Choose and colour each piece separately to make each character your own.\nDueling with deadly results – Send heads and limbs flying as blood rains down and stains the characters and environment. Chop your opponent to pieces, or equip a wooden sword instead for a little mercy and possibly a concussion.",
