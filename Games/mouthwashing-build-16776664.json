    "description": "Mouthwashing is a first-person horror game following the dying crew of a shipwrecked space freighter. Who could have known what good ol’ Captain Curly was capable of? Guess he thought his crew dying alongside him was only right. But some men can’t even kill themselves properly.\nMaimed, limbless and unable to speak, but alive, Curly is now at the mercy of the crew he has doomed to a slow death. Follow the lives of the crew as they weather starvation, isolation , and each other. People were never your strong suit anyway. Red Dead Redemption",
