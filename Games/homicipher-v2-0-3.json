    "description": "When the protagonist wakes up, they find themselves lost in a different world. As they learn the words of the mysterious monsters that speak a strange language , they search for a way to escape. Along the way, will they fall in love with the monster men who come to their aid? Really? In this alternate world, a different language is used. Players will interpret and dechiper characters’ words through expressions, gestures and the objects they point to.\nThe language of this world isn’t as refined as human languages. One meaning is concentrated in one word, with almost no particles ; a string of words conveys only a rough meaning. This is a point-and-click adventure game. Players will investigate items to learn words or engage in conversation to progress. Choices for actions are available at various points. Monster Hunter Stories\nSmall changes in development, branching paths, or even instant death can occur. Even if you reach a game over, you can retry from just before without any penalties. There’s no affection management, and acquiring flags will unlock more choices. Players can freely jump back to previously encountered scenes from chapters and try again. Play comfortably and easily!",
