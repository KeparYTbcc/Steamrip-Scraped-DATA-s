    "description": "Ready to live a freer, more creative life? In The Sims 3, you can let your fantasies run wild as you design your ideal world. Start with your Sim, refining each shape, color and personality trait until you get the precise person that pleases you. Design your dream home, but don’t let a grid limit you; place, rotate and stack furniture and walls freely and to your heart’s content. Once the “hard work” is over, it’s time to be a mentor. Guide your Sim’s path through life, developing a career, finding love , and pursuing dreams and desires.\nAs before, the game is divided into two parts. There is the usual story mode , in which you have to go to a town called Sunset Valley and plunge into the history of one of the families, and there is also a sandbox mode. In the second case, you will have to initially create a character or a whole family, buy out a plot or a finished house, and start a simulation of life. In sandbox mode, you can build your own house the way you want to see it, furnish it, get a job, climb the career ladder, start a family (if it was not created right away), have children, and in general, live a normal life. Life is Strange: Before the Storm Farewell\nSpending time with friends and family is just as important as mastering painting or accumulating knowledge. Take things to the next level and record movies of your Sim’s adventures and share them with the ever-growing and thriving community. With a huge catalog of expansion packs and fun objects to discover, there is no end to the possibilities awaiting you. It all begins here; your adventure awaits",
