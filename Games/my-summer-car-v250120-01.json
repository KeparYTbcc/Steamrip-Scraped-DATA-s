    "description": "MY SUMMER CAR is the ultimate car owning, building, fixing, Rust , maintenance AND permadeath life survival simulator. You start the game with hundreds of loose parts and assemble both car and engine . Not only you need to maintain your car, but yourself as well. Sausages , beer and sleeping will do just fine. If everything goes well, you have a working car which you can use for various 1990â€™s Finnish countryside summer activities.\nBasically doing stupid things under influence of alcohol. After you have gathered extra money from various random jobs, you can start to tune and upgrade the car with parts ordered via snail mail. You can turn the car into a obnoxious bass-boom disco machine or into a rally car to participate rally competitions or just fix it into perfect factory condition . Of course car also needs to pass the inspection or you might get into trouble with police.",
