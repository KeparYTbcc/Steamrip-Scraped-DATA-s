    "description": "In a realm of perpetual evil , a single stone could change everything. Stone Story is an RPG set in a dark and ominous world. Monsters and mysteries plague the realm. Embark on a quest to unite 9 magic Soul Stones and restore the light. Jurassic Park Classic Games Collection\nThe game takes elements from various genres and repackages them into a wholly unique experience. One of Stone Story’s defining mechanics is that you have no direct control of the player character, as an A.I. does all the exploring, combat and looting . Though this is an auto-RPG, that doesn’t mean it’s an idle game. Potions and special abilities are maximized by good timing. Boss fights are intense, requiring quick item swaps if the boss changes patterns.\nYour natural curiosity will be your greatest tool as you delve into the game and discover there’s more beneath its deceptively simple surface.",
