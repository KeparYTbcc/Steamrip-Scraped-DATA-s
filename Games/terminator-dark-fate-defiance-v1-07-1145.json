    "description": "Terminator: Dark Fate – Defiance is a real-time strategy game based on the Terminator: Dark Fate universe that follows the war between humanity and Legion’s synthetic intelligent machine network.\nIn the single-player campaign , you take the role of a commander in the Founders, a force made up of the remnants of the US military and guide your army in an attempt to foil Legion’s plan to exterminate the last remnants of humanity. In skirmish and multiplayer modes, play as three very diverse factions: Founders, Movement and Legion. Call of Duty: Black Ops 6\nTake control of an army carried over from mission to mission on a series of large strategic maps. Make decisions about unit placement, battle tactics and abilities so that you don’t just survive but can become the leader of the resistance against the machines. Hone your skills and military expertise by replaying and achieving the best possible outcomes.\nDynamic battlefields: realistic tactics and consequences\nEngage in complex, realistic battles where your tactical decisions are vital to your survival and ultimate victory. Use a variety of military equipment, vehicles and ammunition types in your battles against the enemy. Recruit and train new units, assign new skills and acquire new weapons and equipment to continue the resistance.\nEncounter tense battles. Your battlefield tactics and choices have deep consequences that will impact through the campaign, with other factions and characters either joining you or fighting against you, and with certain missions being available or not depending on your actions.\nYour resources are limited and you must protect your army. Weapons of war receive damage through a modular component damage system where armour characteristics, component malfunctions and hull structure all affect if your troops survive.",
