    "description": "Welcome to Praslav, a cold Central European city that grows even colder with the coming winter. Praslav is recovering from the political turmoil that followed the end of the Cold War and the fall of the Communist regime, which held the country in its iron grip for decades.While most people eagerly awaited the coming of democracy and capitalism, some were unable to adapt to the new socio-economic climate. Soon they found themselves on t he streets with nowhere to go. Stone Story RPG\nKeep an eye on your needs and other variables, which interact in realistic ways – staying warm, dry, and well-fed are not your only concerns. Poor hygiene and dirty clothes make you smellier, low temperature increases the risk of falling ill, and whatever piece of food comes in must also come out at some point.\nHow far are you willing to go to survive? Steal, burgle, and consort with criminals of all sorts. If necessary, take what you need by force. However, you are not an action hero. Consider your actions carefully, for the consequences are often severe, and benefits rarely ou t weigh the risks. Most importantly, keep your wits about you. Even if you are not willing to hurt people for personal gain, others are.\nSpend the last few days of autumn wisely – gather supplies , equipment, and materials to help you survive the most difficult of seasons. Weather is unpredictable, but there is one certainty – every day is colder than the last. With a lot of preparation and a bit of luck, you might even see the spring again.\nUnlike other survival games, Hobo: Tough Life leans heavily on its story content. Experience dozens of storylines inspired by real-life events and people. Solve quests, meet unique NPCs, gain their trust, make allies and enemies, join various factions, and find your place in the streets of Praslav.",
