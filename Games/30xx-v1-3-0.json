    "description": "30XX combines the crisp controls and fluid movement you love from action platformers like Mega Man X, the replayability of a modern Roguelike ( Binding of Isaac, Enter the Gungeon, Dead Cells, etc) and co-op play into a single gorgeous package. Sclash\nAwaken a thousand years after 20XX to realize the world that needed you is gone, changed irreversibly by the advent of the Synthetic Mind and a human race that’s lost the will to reach for the stars. Explore the lush, verdant prison our world has become, and fight to save what remains. Rise. Fight . Fall. Adapt. There’s a sublime meaning in this endless cycle, somewhere, buried deep.",
