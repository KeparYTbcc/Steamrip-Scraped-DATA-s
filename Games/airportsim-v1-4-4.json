You can follow real aviation charts to move around Lakeside Bar\nLicensed Planes We cooperate closely with plane manufacturers to provide you with a realistic experience of serving the planes. Each of them will have real connection points, door operations , refueling systems, lights, sounds, and general ground procedures during the plane turnaround.
