    "description": "Deep Abyss is composed of independent chapters, connected as one structure. It has a unique Control that seems unfamiliar yet simple to get used to. Explore the deep sea and space yourself as a diver. Swim through strange yet beautiful backgrounds and music. CULTIC\nIt will give you a new gaming experience that you have not felt in other games. The story progresses in the form of poetry rather than a linear composition . It is a game resembling a small painting where you can achieve poetic and artistic sensibility.\nTravel through bizarre landscapes to experience a new, remarkable game you have not yet played. Then, discover what whale you have inside your heart. Interpreting and understanding various signs and symbols in the games are for individual players to decide.\nWe hope such vagueness is reborn as various meanings by players. We hope our game advances the existing customs to consider games as mere entertainment.",
