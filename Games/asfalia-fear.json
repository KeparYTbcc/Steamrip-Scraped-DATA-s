    "description": "Fear doesn’t have to be something negative and painful, it’s a fact of life. And this game lets you embrace it in an unexpectedly wholesome way. Heroes of Hammerwatch II\nWe kept all the things that make point & click fun and removed / improved the annoying stuff. Oh and of course all the dialogues are fully voiced by professional actors. Laika, Lexie, Bosco and Bandit need your help.",
