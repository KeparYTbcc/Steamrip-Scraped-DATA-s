    "description": "My friend introduced me to it and said it was one the best games he’d ever played, and he wasn’t wrong. The game was bursting with ideas and felt genuinely fresh and exciting .\nI can still remember how impressed I was with pretty much everything about it, and it created some lasting memories that have stuck with me to this day including: Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus\nThese are just a few of the memories I have from a game I played a long time ago, so I was looking forward to playing through it again. The graphics of this version received a massive overhaul from the PlayStation game, so it was kind of jarring going back to the original version of Metal Gear Solid. I knew it wasn’t going to be the Twin Snakes version, but let’s just say you can tell this is a game released in 1998.",
