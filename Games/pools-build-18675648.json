    "description": "One could say POOLS is like an art gallery where you look around and listen to the sounds. There are very few things to solve, practically a few mazes. Sometimes the game can challenge your navigation skills. But mostly you’re just… there. Venture to the Vile\nThe game has no user-interface and no dialogue . No background music. Instead, the game uses sounds to make you feel like you’re really there. The sounds and echo change depending on the room you’re in. Walking in water is slower. All of these things makes the game feel more real and creates a tense atmosphere.\nThere’s no typical story, no characters to meet, and you won’t find any notes in game. But as you explore and advance further, you start to notice that the game’s world changes around you. Rooms look and feel different. Each chapter has something unique . Constantly you’re exploring new places, each with its own kind of mystery.",
