    "description": "One final landrush! The planet is dyin’, Astrid , and it’s dig or die trying. That mine under our town is sitting empty, and wouldn’t you know there’s rumours of ancient tech down there that might help us out of this predicament. Round up the posse, circle the wagons, and let’s get to buildin’ a new home. Collect resources above ground and ores down below so we can get those wealthy bots in here to help us build bigger , and we can get the heck out of here Spells & Secrets\nAs your borders expand, new steamfolk will find their way to you! Every bot is crotchety in their own way, and it’s up to you to keep them steaming along. Barter to boost efficiency, keep goods flowing to and from the mines and keep everyone happy to make them work their darndest and hardest .\nStare into the abyss long enough and it might just stare back we’re going looking for riches and something down there doesn’t want to share! Have gun, dig gravel, and make sure the mines don’t collapse upon you as you defend yourselves from the creepy crawlies that lurk within.",
