    "description": "Ever wanted to date a Phone? Excuse me? Shame on you! You can lie to me, y’know, but you CAN’T LIE TO GOD. Dialtown is a dating sim where most people have phones for heads. Women have typewriters . Also, dogs have gramophones for heads. Aaaand , cats have keyboards. The list goes on. Yeah, I’m being serious right now. No, put that straitjacket away. Kiosk\nThe game’s a visual novel where you wander around the town of Dialtown, seeking romance , all because you want someone to pay you into a funfair, all so you can find a dank pit in which to lay your eggs. Yeah.\nThere’s several dateable protagonists , from Karen, a bored bank-teller printer who’s extremely dissatisfied with her life and just wants to feel things again, to Randy, who juggles working as an operator for a local phone sex hotline and working as a bird-wrangler for animal -control.",
