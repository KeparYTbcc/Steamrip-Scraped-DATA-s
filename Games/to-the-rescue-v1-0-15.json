    "description": "To The Rescue! v1.0.15 Download PC Game In Direct Link for free on SteamRIP\nTo The Rescue! is a dog shelter simulator where you are responsible for taking care of dozens of cute dogs in need of homes. It’s not all cuddles and snoot boops though: running a shelter can be a lot of work. You have to manage all of the dogs’ needs in order to maximize their chances of finding the right forever homes. Each day brings new challenges and rewards.\nDogs have specific preferences, can get infectious diseases, and can have negative traits. But you can also hold fundraisers, get random donations, and, if you work hard, help someone find their new best friend. Unfortunately, there’s never enough room, and always more dogs. Some dogs are more desirable than others, but maybe if you can afford to wait long enough, just maybe, every dog will have their day.",
