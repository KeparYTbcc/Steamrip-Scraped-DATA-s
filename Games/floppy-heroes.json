    "description": "Floppy Heroes is a ragdoll physics brawler with dismemberment , a wide range of weapons and armor, very simple controls, and custom battles playable with up to 6 local players. Strike down your opponents using no more than your arrow keys/analog stick (and a button to fire ranged weapons) Dismember your foes with 36 different weapons, including daggers , axes, hammers, staffs, cannons, and more.\nProtect yourself by mixing and matching 60 pieces of armor, with a range of weight and protection. Then top it all off with a choice of hair styles, beards, and color combinations to stand out in the arena. Take on 10 increasingly difficult levels in Singleplayer Mode to earn keys and unlock new equipment, have a four-way brawl in Team Mode, work together to take down a giant in Slay The Titan Mode, or fight your way to the top in Tournament Mode.",
