    "description": "After hostilities have broken out in Central Europe , the race is on as a pressured US Navy escort force battle off Soviet bomber and submarine attacks on a perilous quest to reinforce NATO defenders in Europe. Meanwhile, in the Persian Gulf, the conflict between Iran and Iraq risks escalating into a larger confrontation between superpowers as both sides indiscriminately attack neutral merchant shipping.\nAnd in the Norwegian Sea, an outnumbered Soviet surface force challenges the might of a massive US Navy amphibious force bound for occupied Norway The Rise of the Golden Idol\nBrought to you by the lead designer of Cold Waters, Sea Power lets you control NATO and Warsaw Pact forces in a modern naval conflict. Whether itâ€™s gunning it out with Boghammars in a surface duel, fighting off aerial attackers armed with long-range missiles , or hunting for enemy submarines with aircraft and surface ships, advanced weaponry and sensors are at your disposal.",
