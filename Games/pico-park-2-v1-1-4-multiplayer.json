All levels can be played no matter how many players you have, so jump in with your friends and take ’em on!\nOnline play also features cross-platform support, allowing you to play with your friends no matter what platform you have! Also, up to 7 players can join online with a single PC.\nAdded alongside the WORLD, ENDLESS, and BATTLE modes is the slightly unfair, somewhat difficult DARK mode! Jump, plot, and plunge into the all-new PICO PARK 2",
