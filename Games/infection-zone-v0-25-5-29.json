    "description": "The Mad Virus” has spread throughout the world with the speed of jet planes. The infected are highly aggressive, fast and strong. In a couple of weeks, society collapsed. Cities are empty. There is no electricity, no water, and no food. Yet, there are a few survivors FIFA 16\nType in the name of the city or town, download the map and start playing Thanks to OpenStreetMap’s real-world data you can choose any place in the world for your survivors . Establish a new “Infection Free Zone” wherever you choose. Set up shelters and production facilities. Adapt existing buildings to new needs. Build new farms and power houses. Establish defenses with walls, gates, and towers.\nUtilize your knowledge of the city. What is the best place to defend? Where were the grocery stores, where were the pharmacies ? Where would you look for weapons? Remember that it’s dangerous to search the old buildings, there might be some infected lurking in the dark",
