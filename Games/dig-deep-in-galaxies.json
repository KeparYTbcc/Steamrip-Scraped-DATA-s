    "description": "Attention! The Overlord has enacted some new laws to keep the galaxies safe and peaceful. He’s not a bad guy he just doesn’t want things to get out of hand. And some stupid rebels are already stirring things up, which isn’t cool. Order has been restored, and revolutions are definitely not allowed. Turbo Dismount\nThere are loads of weapons, items, skills and even potions out there for sure. But they’re strictly forbidden So don’t even think about going around combining everything and causing trouble. It’s way too much power.\nWhy destroy everything? What would your mother say? It is technically possible to go on a super sweet galactic journey with your pals where you basically destroy everything in sight and crush the “bad guys”but it’s banned, big no-no.\nThere are tons of mysterious (and possibly exciting) things out there, but you can get lost in the galaxy . And then what? Who’s going to look for you? Don’t go traveling around trying to find new stuff, it’s 100% forbidden.",
