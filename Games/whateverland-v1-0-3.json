    "description": "â€œ Whateverland is a hand-painted point-n-click adventure game with a branching dialogue system, non-linear gameplay, various endings and unique in-game turn-based board game. Find your way out of a magical prison called Whateverland with a charming ghost Nick by your side, get to meet the charismatic locals, steal and deceive or be a good boy and help others to discover all the different endings to this bizarre adventure. Each level can be completed in at least two different ways: you either steal from people or help them. Technicity\nThe rich branching dialogues will tell you more about the world and its inhabitants, as well as influence your relationship with Whateverlanders and your sidekick Nick. There is no particular order of chapters in this game. More than that, if you ever feel stuck, you can drop your current chapter at any point in the story, and move to another one. And then another one",
