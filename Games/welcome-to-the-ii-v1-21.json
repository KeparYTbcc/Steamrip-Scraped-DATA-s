    "description": "Welcome to the Game II is an atmospheric horror / strategy / puzzle game that takes you into the world of the deep web, in search of the shadow web. Why are you in search of the shadow web? Let’s take you back into the story. You play as Clint Edwards, an investigative reporter in a major metropolitan area. You wake up from a nap to sounds coming from your computer.\nAmalea says something about the shadow web, and that there are men in masks hunting her down. When trying to explain her location, the stream abruptly ends. This peaks Clint’s interest, and he must dig deeper to find her before it’s too late. But little does Clint know that the deep web is not a place to poke around. You never know who else is around to poke back.",
