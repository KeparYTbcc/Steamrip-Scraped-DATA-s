    "description": "Three goblins have had enough of the intolerant society they are surrounded by. They have devised a brilliant plan to infiltrate sanctuaries of human indulgence, to fight for change by getting drunk . PC Tycoon 2\nGoblin legends tell of a beverage devised by ever-inventive humans, hidden away in their taprooms. They call it “beer”. By controlling their delicate balance you will guide them through various pubs, markets, and banquet halls. Try not to blow their cover as they wobble through suspecting crowds, slippery tavern halls, and precarious castle walls.\nUtilize multiple routes through each level and open shortcuts by outsmarting various human contraptions and solving simple puzzles. Be careful! Try not to fall and blow your disguise , as humans are suspicious creatures, and will kick you out of their town if they discover your dastardly plan.",
