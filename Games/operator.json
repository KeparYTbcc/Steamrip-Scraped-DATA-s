    "title": "OPERATOR",
    "description": "In OPERATOR, you will play as an elite “Tier 1” operator undergoing dangerous clandestine operations all across the globe. With a strategic , measured, and unforgiving style of gameplay. OPERATOR aims to be the ultimate tactical shooter with total realism in mind. Featuring realistic weapon handling, ballistics, injury, gore, and active ragdolls.\nOur goal is to fully immerse you in the game world. Making every interaction physically accurate such as opening/closing doors, interacting with switches , activating/deactivating night vision goggles, no automatic operation of firearms, and many more. Essentially VR gaming without the VR headset.\nWith multiplayer co-op in mind going up against the enemy solo is a risky endeavor that will most likely get you killed. Team up with your friends and use a variety of tools and special tactics in order to get the job done. At your disposal are many different types of breaching tools and grenades all with their own pros and cons to respect. Train hard together and leave nothing to chance.",
