    "description": "Here you will have to go in the role of a human child to the underworld , get acquainted with its inhabitants, and try to establish a dialogue between people and the once slain monsters of the dungeons The plot of the game revolves around an ordinary human child who randomly fell into the underworld, where monsters defeated in the war are hiding. It would seem that the child should now fight for his own life and just survive.\nBut no â€“ in fact, the game offers much more than just battles . You will have to contact pixel NPCs, monitor their feelings and emotions, talk to them, choose the right actions and thus influence them and the entire underworld. The most interesting thing is the modifiable behavior of the NPC . If you are tolerant of them and try to use non-violent methods of reprisal .",
