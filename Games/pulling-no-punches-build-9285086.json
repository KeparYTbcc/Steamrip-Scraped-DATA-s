    "description": "Pulling No Punches is a satirical game in the 2D beat’em up style with classic arcade influences and modern visuals. The game follows the fictional story of a global pandemic that engulfed the world and is being ignored by fanatics who do not believe that the disease is real. It is up to the main characters, 4 common citizens adequately protected with gloves and masks, to deal with these fanatics and solve the situation with the force of their own fists .\nIf you love the “beat’em up” genre, then here you have to, armed with masks, gloves and your fists, beat the inhabitants of the city who do not believe in a pandemic. The game supports co-op on one computer up to 4 people. So call your friends and go to the streets of the city to stop the madmen who spread the infection. Arcade Paradise",
