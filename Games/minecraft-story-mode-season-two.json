    "description": "Now that Jesse and the gang have vanquished the Wither Storm, saved the world, and become totally super famous heroes, life has gotten a bit more complicated. With more responsibilities and less time for adventure, old friendships have started to fade at least until Jesse’s hand gets stuck in a creepy gauntlet that belongs to an ancient underwater temple. Minecraft: Story Mode Complete Season Together with old pals and new comrades alike, Jesse embarks on a brand new journey filled with tough choices, good times, and at least one temperamental llama. Includes access to all 5 episodes (Episodes 1-5 available now) in this brand new season from the award-winning studio, Telltale Games.",
