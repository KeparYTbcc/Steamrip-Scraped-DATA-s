    "description": "BUCKSHOT ROULETTE is a tabletop horror game that attempts to re-design the infamous game of Russian Roulette, replacing the traditional revolver with a proper 12-gauge pump -action shotgun. This extra firepower, and more importantly the different mechanics in handling a shotgun compared to a revolver , offers a fresh take on the classic and deadly game of chance. Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew\nThe game takes place at the top of an underground nightclub , where the metal railings tremble to the pulse of long lost drum machines. A crooked AI dealer is waiting for you. Will you meet them?",
