    "description": "Get FNAF 3 v1.0.32 PC game for free instantly and play pre-installed on SteamRiP\nThirty years after Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza closed it’s doors, the events that took place there have become nothing more than a rumor and a childhood memory, but the owners of “Fazbear’s Fright: The Horror Attraction” are determined to revive the legend and make the experience as authentic as possible for patrons , going to great lengths to find anything that might have survived decades of neglect and ruin. At first there were only empty shells, a hand, a hook, an old paper-plate doll, but then a remarkable discovery was made.\nThe attraction now has one animatronic . The most interesting thing about 5 Nights at Freddy’s 3 is that this time you will not have a battery for a flashlight, or even a battery for light. Now all gameplay is based on security cameras located on a two-tier system and a tablet. Cameras and their systems will break down every now and then and you will need to reboot them using your tablet. The moment you reboot, you become as vulnerable as possible. Ori and the Blind Forest\nWhat is no less important, as in previous games in the series, in this one you will also have to go through mini-games, on which the plot of the game will depend. By the way, Five Nights at Freddy’s 3 has several endings: one bad and the other good. At the same time, regardless of the ending, you will definitely see all the animatronics from the previous parts and you can finally understand why the animatronics attacked the guards.",
