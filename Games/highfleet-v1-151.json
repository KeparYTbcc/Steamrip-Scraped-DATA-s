The House of Sayadi sends its thousand-ton military ships to the skies. Stirring the peace of nations inhabiting the earth they strive to bring back what they have lost. As a commander of the Sayadi Task Force you’ve been sent to regain control of the rebellious Kingdom of Gerat by whatever means necessary.\nTo succeed will require careful exploration, clever resource management, cautious diplomacy and building a fleet capable of ruling the skies unchallenged. But maybe a much greater destiny awaits you in this journey. As this forsaken land still hides the mysterious prophecies of a long forgotten past. Passpartout: The Starving Artist\nKiller combat At the heart of HighFleet is a unique form of combat in which giant ships bristling with weaponry duel above the desert. This is no mindless button mashing, however. Far from it. Battles are won by skillfully moving into positions that allow you to exploit your enemies’ weak spots.\nSerious strategy Mastering HighFleet requires much more than winning battles. You must explore the mysterious lands of Gerat. You must manage your ships, men, fuel and other resources. You must engage in diplomacy with the various factions. And then there’s the prophecy to be unraveled\nFreedom to fly Thanks to HighFleet’s in-game ship editor, you can build the perfect fleet to suit your style of fighting. The many distinctive ship options and upgrade paths ensure the game will provide plenty of replay value.",
