    "description": "The day has come when the book is no longer enjoyable, the jokes of the cellmates next door are no longer funny, and it’s time to break out of this boring prison. Get some tools and start digging.\nWays to survive in prison. Maybe you can trade with the guard for some goodies, maybe the guys will give you something better to dig in exchange for toilet paper. PGA TOUR 2K23\nWatch out for the guard’s inspections, cover the carpet, remove the sand you dig up in the toilet, don’t get caught. Get food, better shoes, and bigger shovels. Exercise to have more strength and energy, buy better backpacks to dig more valuable items from the ground.\nPimp the pad. Maybe you can buy something from Mrs. Dorothy in the prison warehouse? Buy furniture, glow sticks, more beautiful carpets, and better toilets to remove the sand faster.\nGet respect or get buried. In Prison Escape Simulator, gambling isn’t just a pastime — it’s a way to gain influence. Money and reputation are all on the line. Every bet carries risk: you might get rich or end up in debt. Play smart, because in this prison, bluffing can be just as powerful as digging.\nSo, will you survive behind bars and prepare for the grand escape? Read the letters with hints on how deep and in which direction to dig, and maybe one day you’ll get out of prison?\nIn Prison Escape Simulator: Dig Out you can mine, trade, upgrade your cell and have tons of fun when no one is watching. A few hours of excitement for the price of a burger. Will you escape?",
