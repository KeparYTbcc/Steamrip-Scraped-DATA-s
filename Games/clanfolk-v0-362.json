    "description": "Clanfolk is a challenging medieval colony sim that takes you to the Scottish Highlands and pits you against nature itself. Starting with an empty plot of land and only your closest family, you will learn to survive as you establish your hearth and home, watch over your livestock, harvest your fields, and fight the bitter winter. Whether you grow your fledgling settlement into a bustling inn or a central trade hub, or you instead content yourself with building a prosperous and self-sufficient homestead or livestock ranch, everything rests in your hands – including the very lives of your clanfolk.\nCraft your family’s story from start to finish across multiple generations, building a home from nothing, and leaving behind a legacy for generations to come. Create your precise lineage or choose from an existing clan, then take charge of a multi-generational family seeking to survive in the harsh Scottish Highlands.\nYour family members will get married, have children, grow old, and eventually pass away, leaving their contributions and struggles to be carried on by the next generation. Manage schedules to make sure everyone is well rested, well fed, and reasonably happy without risking your family’s preparedness for when the harsh winter inevitably settles in. Morning rituals , socializing, and rest punctuate a day of chores: sowing seeds, tilling soil, fishing, hunting, crafting, and cooking. Every member of the family has their own traits, aspirations, dreams, and skills that help determine what they do best.\nThey will care for themselves and for each other, and they will seek to better themselves over time. Your youngest family members are full of potential and learn from working alongside their elders – teach them to hunt, cook, clean, build, or farm, ensuring all the core survival skills are carried forward to the next generation when the elders must be put to rest. The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim VR\nThe warm summers give way to crisp fall nights and brutal winters before life and spring return to the highlands – your survival depends on your ability to plan ahead and adapt to the flow of the seasons. Each season presents its own challenges and opportunities – whether picking berries, trapping eels, hunting rabbit, or seeking out mushroom patches, you’ll need to make the most of the opportunities of medieval life. Soil conditions change and a host of factors impact how well your crops grow. Till the soil, employ techniques like slash-and-burn farming, and train the right farmers to keep your clan fed.",
