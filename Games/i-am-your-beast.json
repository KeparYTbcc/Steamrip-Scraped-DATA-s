Retired for six years, you’ve been asked to complete ‘one last job’, one too many times. Declining your latest mission sets in motion a furious guerilla war between you and the Covert Operations Initiative (COI) that litters the forest with bodies and bullet casings.\nBreak your opponents. Use their own equipment against them. Duck into your tunnel network before enemy forces zero in on your location. Repeat. MARVEL vs. CAPCOM Fighting Collection",
