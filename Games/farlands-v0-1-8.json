So, with little more than your worn-out ship and your personal assistance droid, you decide to embark on a new phase of your life in a lost corner of the galaxy. Valley Peaks\nRestore your planet\nCut weeds, clear paths, reclaim fields, and fix what the passage of time has destroyed . Turn an old agrarian rock into a thriving homestead.\nExplore the solar system\nAlthough your ship has seen better days, it can still help you move between the different planets in the solar system, explore them, and collect resources to improve your farm, your tools, and your ship.\nBe part of the community\nMake contact with the handful of people who still live on the solar system’s planets. Learn their stories and the reasons why they decided to stay in such a remote part of the galaxy.",
