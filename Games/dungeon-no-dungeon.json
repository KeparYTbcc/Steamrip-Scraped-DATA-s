    "description": "Get Dungeon No Dungeon PC game for free instantly and play pre-installed on SteamRiP\nHi, I’m the producer behind the indie game Dungeon No Dungeon, Larcen. The game is our 3-man (now) dev team’s maiden voyage into the world of game development. It’s our team of university graduates’ pride and joy, the result of two years of hard graft, and we really hope you enjoy and appreciate it Dungeon No Dungeon is a turn-based roguelike game with a unique hand-drawn art style, with a strategy system based around body parts that you’ve likely never encountered before.\nBuilding on its individual art style and strategy system, we’ve worked in roguelike elements and all sorts of weird and wonderful random encounters, not to mention the Lovecraftian elements to ramp up the thrill. Aside from this, the game was first conceptualized as a board game. As time went on, we fell in love with the idea of creating a video game of our own, and so decided to make it into the Dungeon No Dungeon of today.",
