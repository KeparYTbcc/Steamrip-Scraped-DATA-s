    "description": "Building on the best aspects of UnderMine , an acclaimed action-adventure roguelike, UnderMine 2 takes dungeon crawling to a whole new level! Discover, combine, craft, and transmute powerful relics and take your lowly peasant from zero to hero. Trivial human politics distract as cosmic machinations unfold â€” there is more than one war in Delvemore. While King Faraam IV attempts to regain control of his kingdom, the unseen war between two daemonic siblings ripples the fabric of reality. Abiotic Factor",
