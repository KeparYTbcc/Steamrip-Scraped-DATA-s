    "description": "A doomed sailor is shipwrecked on an uncharted island. In fog -shrouded valleys, where grinning, mossy corpses cling to rusted arms, shambling figures begin to stir. Beneath crumbling, salt-worn structures, labyrinthine passageways lead to unspeakable evil, long forgotten by man.\nSalt and Sanctuary seamlessly combines fast, brutal, and complex 2D combat with richly developed RPG mechanics. Discover, craft, and upgrade over 600 weapons, armor pieces, spells, and items as you explore a cursed realm of forgotten cities, blood-soaked dungeons , desecrated monuments, and the fallen lords they once celebrated. BioGun\nFrom Ska Studios, the award-winning indie studio behind a long list of stylistic, visceral , and brutally executed action titles that includes The Dishwasher: Vampire Smile, The Dishwasher: Dead Samurai, and Charlie Murder, comes Salt and Sanctuary , the studioâ€™s most ambitious title to date.",
