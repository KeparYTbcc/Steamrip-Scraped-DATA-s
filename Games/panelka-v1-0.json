    "description": "Panelka is a relaxing simulation game filled with warmth and nostalgia, which will take you back to the cozy times of childhood and youth. In it, you will arrange a post-Soviet apartment with furniture and items, creating a familiar cozy atmosphere for many. The game gives you the chance to explore the details of the past, revisit old memories, and once again feel the joy and carefree spirit of those years while creating your creative space.\nYou have access to classic apartment layouts from the late 80s and early 90s – from Khrushchyovkas to panel buildings. Choose your favorite option and place the furniture however your heart desires – there are no restrictions. If something doesn’t fit, easily move items to any place. Titanfall 2\nThe game offers a huge selection of wallpapers and paints for the walls. Create unique combinations, experiment with colors, or choose stylish brick walls. Everything depends on your imagination!",
