    "description": "Combining furious run ‘n’ gun action and deep, roguelike mechanics, Neon Abyss pits you as a member of ‘Grim Squad’ – a task force set-up by Hades himself to infiltrate the Abyss and defeat the New Gods. Death is not the end as every time you die, you’ll find yourself more empowered than before.\nAs you progress through each dungeon , random item drops will be key in helping you infiltrate the Abyss and these passive effects can stack between every item. With no limit to how many can apply; a wide variety of combinations will make each run unique. With each run, you will be able to unlock new rooms, items, bosses , special rules and even new endings This means each dungeon is unique and expandable, being tailored to your own specific playstyle .",
