    "description": "Tiny Glade is a relaxing free-form building game. Tap into the joy of making something pretty with no management, no combat, or wrong answers – just kick back, doodle some castles, and turn forgotten meadows into lovable dioramas. Class of ’09: The Flip Side\nExplore gridless building chemistry , and watch the game carefully assemble every brick, pebble and plank, adapting to your whim. Draw a path through a building? A door pops up! Raise the building? Columns and beams line up to support it.\nThere are no wrong answers or failure states. You can change your mind at any time, and whatever you make will look cozy out of the box .\nLet yourself unwind to the chill vibes, and escape into a world that feels alive. Ivy envelops your buildings, sheep waddle through your paths, and fireflies light up the night .",
