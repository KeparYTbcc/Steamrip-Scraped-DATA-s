    "description": "Nunholy is an action-packed roguelike game where you explore dungeons and hunt down vampires as battle-hardened nuns. Dragon Ball XenoVerse\nEach time you slay a vampire , you can absorb their power to grow stronger or sell it to upgrade your gear. Will you embrace the vampires’ dark power, or rely solely on human strength? The choice is yours.\nVampires come in many forms and ranks—Knights, Barons , Counts, and Dukes—each stronger than the last. Hunt down the most powerful of them all and prove yourself as an S-rank hunter.\nWithin the dungeons , you’ll encounter merchants, witches, prisoners, and undertakers—people who care little about who you are, as long as you can pay. Meet them, trade with them, and prepare for the hunt .",
