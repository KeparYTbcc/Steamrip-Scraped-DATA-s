    "description": "SUMMERHOUSE is a small-scale building game and a love letter to the feeling of long lost summer afternoons.\nCraft a neighbourhood of tiny, beautiful lived-in homes in a variety of settings: the sea, the city, or the mountains. While there are some little secrets to uncover , there are no rules, and you canâ€™t win or lose. Just chill out, build to your heartâ€™s content and soak up the atmosphere. Contra: Operation Galuga\nIf relaxation and creation are your thing, this is a game for you ðŸ™‚",
