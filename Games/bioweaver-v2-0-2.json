    "description": "In a mysterious underground laboratory, dangerous creatures have escaped. The road to the surface is blocked by many obstacles, but top scientists never complain about the environment. The organs and genes of unknown creatures can be your power. Make good use of them and create yourself a path of flesh and blood.\nUse simple programming logic to build organ links. The skill building process is highly visualized and can be easily debugged. The game includes hundreds of organs with different functions. Each organ can also be mutated to obtain additional affixes which can further generate more unpredictable changes.\nThe difficulty of the game can be automatically adjusted to the progress of the game. After completing the main acts, there are still more difficult challenges, more modes and content to explore. Haydee 3",
