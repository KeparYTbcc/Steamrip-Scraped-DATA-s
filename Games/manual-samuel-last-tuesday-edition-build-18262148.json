    "description": "Manual Samuel is a hilarious , hand-drawn adventure game with a wild twist. After making a deal with Death, our hero, the spoiled rich-kid Samuel, must survive for 24 hours controlling his entire body manually.\nFrom breathing and blinking to driving and working, all these tasks will fall to you. It won’t be easy, with Death himself tagging along for the ride, you might be in some very deep feces\nUsing your keyboard or controller, you’ll have to manually breathe, blink , drink, walk, talk and more — one clumsy input at a time. Can you keep Samuel alive, or will he flop his way back to the afterlife?\nFrom getting dressed, driving to work and (checks notes) fighting robots? – Help Samuel navigate his day to ensure he returns to his lavish life and girlfriend\nLooking to lose friends or break up with your significant other? Then this mode is perfect for you",
