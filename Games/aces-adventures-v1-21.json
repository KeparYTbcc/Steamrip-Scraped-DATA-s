    "description": "Three tables stand in a circle of stones in the misty heart of the old woods, forming a portal to a soaring world drawn from the pages of ancient Norse and Middle Eastern mythology . There, you will embark on a journey to save Cardrasil, the Life Tree, from the evil that gnaws at her roots. Each card of the enchanted deck she entrusts to you are leaves plucked from her very branches. Use them to evoke your abilities and unleash devastating, poker-powered attacks. A Little to the Left\nGrow your own power , prune your own deck, but make haste! The seasons are changing; warmth won’t be free for long. A unique combination of traditional playing cards and special ability cards sits at the heart of Aces & Adventures. You’ll craft a deck and choose how to use your resources do you aim to defeat your opponents through attacks and spells , or play cards in order to potentially draw devastating high-value poker hands and obliterate your foes in a mighty blow?",
