    "description": "To say there’s been hype surrounding The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom would not just be an understatement, but a fairly poor opening line to any sort of hands-on feature. On an unrelated note, Nintendo recently invited us to go and have a go at The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom at their European headquarters in Frankfurt . We got a whopping 70 minutes with the game, which felt like no more than ten with all the stuff we wanted to proverbially bathe ourselves in, so how did it hold up?\nHas this so-called hype been justified? We opened with a short session on a Sky Island designed to allow us to get to grips with the controls and play around with the new mechanics (or at the very least begin to). We were initially a little bit overwhelmed as we were told in not quite so many words to ‘go nuts’ with everything that lay before us. We had a pop with the Ultrahand and quickly discovered that we have a far less robust understanding of physics than we thought.\nWe tried to shield surf after attaching a fan to our makeshift surfboard . Spoiler alert: it didn’t go well. We also discovered, little to our surprise, that the Fuse ability is just as open — and has the potential to be as mindlessly stupid — as you wish, and we mean that in the best possible way. You can’t actually attach an apple to the end of a sword and expect it to do any good, can you? We had a similarly short-sighted mindset at first, but after trying it for ourselves we are happy to report that ‘for goodness sake, of course it gives you a minor attack boost, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild\nNot only is it the sequel to what’s considered one of the greatest games of all time, but it’s one of the few times two brand-new Zelda games have arrived in the lifespan of a single Nintendo console. It’ll be the Nintendo Switch’s most important, must-have game since Animal Crossing. You may want to avoid spoilers about the new game, but not all that much has been revealed.",
