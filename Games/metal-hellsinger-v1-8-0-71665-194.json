Destroy the demon hordes and their leaders to set yourself up for an epic showdown with The Red Judge herself. RUMBLE VR\nMetal: Hellsinger is a rhythm FPS , where your ability to shoot on the beat will enhance your gameplay experience. The more in sync you are with the rhythm, the more intense the music will become and the more destruction you will cause.

Although commonly known as Hell, The Infernal Planes is in reality a union of a thousand Hells, all of which are terrifying and diabolical in their own way.\nIn order to dethrone The Red Judge, you must fight your way through the fiercest corners, from the icy world of Voke to the maddening world of Stygia.
