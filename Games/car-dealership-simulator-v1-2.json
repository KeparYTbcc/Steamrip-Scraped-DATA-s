    "description": "Car Dealership Simulator is an extremely comprehensive and detailed car dealership business simulation game, contains detailed car buying and selling mechanics. Buy, price, clean and sell your cars. Upgrade, improve, keep your car dealership clean and earn the respect of your customers, be the best car dealer around. Bargaining system can be added in sales as well as in purchases. I also skipped writing, I couldn’t figure out if there is a connection about the arrival of customers according to the profit rate of the vehicles, but if it is added, it would be great. In other words, if what I bought for 100 is sold for 105, if it is sold in x time, when I sell it for 107, it can be sold in 3x time.\nWhen the game opens, it helps us to see at least which level we are at, as the stars are filled by showing 6 hollow stars and gaining skill . I couldn’t unlock the 100th and 300th achievements, but I already have 200m in 70 days and it seems unnecessary to play the rest, I don’t think it’s an event worth returning 230 days.\nApart from what I have mentioned, a bank and credit system can be brought into the game. Depending on the slots opened in each new garage purchased, the amount of available credits can be increased. Even with low quality models, it would be really fun if the variety of vehicles was increased a little. Another problem is that the gallery ends with max 15 slots. With the parking logic in cms, the same place can be shown as if it has more than 1 floor and the number of slots can increase. Creed: Rise to Glory\nAs I said, 15 slots end with 8 luxury and 7 normal vehicles in 5 hours. Apart from that, there are no random events, so there is no activity in the game. The star system in the game is very easy, you become 6 stars Once the price is set, it does not change with our request, for example, this should be changed. which we can say has just entered the simulation games and includes vehicles we know like Fiat Egea.\nFirst thing I want to say is that the game is still in Early Access. Because it is a naive game, I honestly believe that it can be improved day by day. Incoming customers are making very close offers, suggesting 997k for the 1m vehicle, this scissors can be opened a little more It’s probably not an easy process, but I don’t think there is an audience that will be hooked on the graphics like those who play the game.\nThe arrival of the paid staff employment system will be very good in terms of the vitality and immersion of the game. If we take a quick look at the other aspects, the graphics and texture quality is as good as it should be in a simulation game personally. Although the sounds and effects are not visible, they do not give the player a poor quality feeling. Apart from this, the game had its shortcomings, but until I wrote this review, the producer studio was very interested and closed all the deficiencies",
