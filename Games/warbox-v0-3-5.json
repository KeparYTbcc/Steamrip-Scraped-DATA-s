    "description": "Warbox lets players simulate realistic firefights with intelligent AI. Players are not only able to watch the battles happen but can take control of any soldier they like. A built-in faction and soldier customization system lets players design their own factions and soldiers in those factions. KUR\nPlayers can define the roles for each soldier like squad leaders, medics, anti-tank, and more. Today, you wonâ€™t surprise anyone with a tactical shooter, when there is such a project as ARMA 3, it would seem that Warbox is completely unnecessary. But this game definitely has its advantages . One of which is a good artificial intelligence, and the other is an advanced constructor that allows you to fine-tune the enemy, the terrain and simulate various events. Actually, this game is more of a constructor than a shooter , but at the same time you will find good physics and an interesting system of damage to soldiers.",
