Upon arriving, they’re greeted by a masked figure who claims to know their Aunt Kate, before she died and needs their help finding something Aunt Kate had left in the library. They also warn of a powerful entity that seems to be drawn to the tapes.\nMeanwhile, Amanda is now aware of Riley’s presence, and is doing everything to find a way to free herself. Suddenly, the stakes are higher than ever before, as it’s not just Amanda looking for Riley now.",
