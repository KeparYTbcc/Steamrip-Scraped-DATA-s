    "description": "This is a road trip game in an almost infinite random generated desert. The focus is on freedom , driving, exploration and immersion. It has minimal car maintenance and survival elements. There are no invisible walls or unable to jump over small fences, or blinking red “wrong direction” signs on the hud. The car won’t need 10-20 liter fuel over just only a few hundred meters, with a full tank, you could go approximately 500 kilometers.\nIf you see a distant big mountain , you can go there and if you are capable, you can climb it. If you don’t like where the mirrors are facing you can adjust them however you want or throw them away while driving at full speed. If you want to lean out of the car , or closer to the radio or near anything, you can.",
