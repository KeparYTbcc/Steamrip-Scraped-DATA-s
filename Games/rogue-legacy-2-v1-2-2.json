That means it has all the trappings of a typical rogue-like (randomized runs, changing characters, and more), but with persistent upgrades , and persistent dead heirs. In this game, your legacy defines you. Spend your parents’ inheritance and grow the family manor to give your children a better fighting chance.\nEach child is unique , with their own traits and abilities. Your daughter could be an archer. She could also be a Vegan. Rogue Legacy 2 also lets you play how you want to. Go hard and fast, and you can dive deeper into the depths of a randomly-generated world. Or take it slow and steady , and build your character up until you’re ready for greater challenges .\n",
