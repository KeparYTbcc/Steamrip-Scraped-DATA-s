    "description": "The driven pass option is usually highlighted in a new feature called the “FIFA Trainer,” a pop-up box that appears next to the ball-controlling player. It suggests commands depending on the situation. Veterans will likely turn this off, but as a striver in this field I appreciated the reminder, not only that I could do something other than a basic pass or shot, but how to do it. The combined effect of the new commands and options is a very welcoming, very inclusive FIFA, which is appropriate considering one of its centerpiece features, the debut of women’s soccer. Ereban: Shadow Legacy\nThe women’s teams are noticeably slower-paced, which answers the question of why you can’t take them against a men’s side. Their smaller goalkeepers also give up rebounds where a male counterpart would scoop up the ball, so a player would be wise to follow her shot by switching to any player close in the neighborhood or, if on defense, whale on the clear button (B or circle) to get it out of town. It’s a neat strategic consideration to keep in mind. The women’s “International Tournament ” plays a lot like college soccer, which is appropriate considering American universities’ outsize influence on the sport. Even at higher difficulty settings, mismatched teams will produce some extreme statistical totals, particularly shots on goal.\nWomen’s soccer in FIFA 16 isn’t some dumbed -down version of the game, because the slower pace allows greater precision in passing, movement and defense, meaning deadly counterattacks are always on the table. On the whole, playing with the women’s teams gives a player more time to consider his or her strategy than in the men’s professional side of FIFA 16. Announcers Martin Tyler and Alan Smith also support the women’s teams with dialogue specific to their players and clubs .\nI still wish there were more for them to do. The modes in which the women’s sides are available an unbranded tournament that maxes out at six matches, or standard one-off play don’t provide enough context to support what is otherwise an admirably different way of playing soccer. EA Sports’ forthright and respectable presentation of the differences in women’s soccer means their players can’t show up in a mixed-gender competition like Ultimate Team or Be a Pro. But if you want to create a larger story for any of the 12 women’s teams, all you have to work with is a single generic tournament. What, I wonder, would have prevented FIFA 16 from offering a 22-match fantasy league of these women’s national teams, playing everyone home and road, with the aggregated statistics and player progression enjoyed in the men’s game?",
