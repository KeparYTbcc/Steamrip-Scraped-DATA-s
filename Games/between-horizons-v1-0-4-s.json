    "description": "Between Horizons is set aboard the Zephyr, humanity’s first generation ship en route to another star. You assume the role of Stella, who was born on the ship 24 years ago and recently inherited her father’s post as Chief of Security. Dive into the conspiracy behind the incident that threatens to disrupt the Zephyr’s social order and foil its mission. Infinity Strash\nBetween Horizons is a modern 2.5D pixel art adventure that brings a branching narrative into a semi-open world. The team at DigiTales has applied numerous lessons from their first game Lacuna and proven solutions to detective game design problems to maximize player agency in the investigation process all the while maintaining the tight pacing of a meaningful story that will ask you to reevaluate your moral compass and make increasingly tough decisions as the situation aboard the ship spirals out of control.",
