    "description": "Window seat or aisle? Booth or table? Lone wolf or life of the party? In Is This Seat Taken?, your mission is to organize groups of people according to their preferences. It’s a cozy, no-pressure logic puzzle game where you’re in charge of who sits where. Heretic + Hexen\nWhether it’s the cinema , a crowded bus, a wedding reception, or a cramped taxi cab, every setting introduces new characters with specific tastes. A party guest with a sensitive nose won’t be happy sitting next to a stranger who’s wearing too much cologne. A sleepy passenger won’t be happy trying to nap on the bus next to someone listening to loud music. It’s all about reading the room to find the perfect placement!\nNat is an aspiring actor whose world gets turned upside down when they see a shape just like them on the big screen. This discovery sends Nat on a global journey to meet their hero and figure out how to fit in. Experience Nat’s heartfelt story as you travel from city to city , each with its own levels, characters, and charm.",
