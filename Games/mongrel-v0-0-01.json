    "description": "The intellect of the humans has faltered, only one woman is the mother to every child and troublemakers are getting flushed in the toilet. Delve through the world of Yonder and uncover the secrets behind this twisted society. Find new weapons, upgrades and perks by opening ancient eggs in the wild. For a better chance to fight your way to the depths of the underworld , an arsenal of the most powerful weapons is indubitably needed.\nThe humans never forget about your sins, so minimize the sins and give them fake compliments to get a higher status. The only way you’ll be able to get any intimacy with a female is to get to the very top of the social ladder, but should you fall to the bottom, you’ll get hunted by the very people you set out to impress",
