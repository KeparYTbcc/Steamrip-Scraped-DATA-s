    "description": "[The tale of a twisted metamorphosis] I woke up and found myself made Out of Hands. You are an ineffable being, one of wriggling fingers and flesh. Step into a nightmare like no other that unfolds forevermore. Insanity , uncertainty and the bizarre await\n[The line between dreams and reality begins to blur.] With real video footage cut into collage, everyday objects take on a chilling new form. Mix and match organs, and ready your weapons. Wield these peculiar objects, and claw your way out of the dream world.\n[Cling to your sanity, and fight for your life.] Muster what remains of your shattered psyche and do battle with foes formed of contorted memories, of crushing emotions. Innovative card-game mechanics mean everythingâ€™s a weapon. So keep your cool , consider your moves, and decide: will you play it safe, or go for the throat? Throne of Bone",
