    "description": "In Driftwood, you’ll experience high-speed downhill longboarding as an aerodynamic sloth. Drifting is the name of the game, as it’ll help you strike the perfect balance between speed and control. Drift through tight corners to avoid collision with cars and obstacles, and perform wicked tricks as you take in the beautiful landscape around you. These tricks will help you score points, which will unlock new boards that can be combined with various wheels for diverse skating styles. AirportSim\nWe’re a small team consisting of just one artist and one programmer. We’ve set out to make a game that provides an intense downhill longboarding experience without much fluff , just a focus on drifting and flow. While there are no freestyle skateboarding tricks in Driftwood, we hope you enjoy the content in our game",
