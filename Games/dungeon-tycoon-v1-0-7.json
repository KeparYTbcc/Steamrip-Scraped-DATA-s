    "description": "In Dungeon Tycoon, you have complete freedom to build and manage your own dungeon. You not only design the layout, but choose the best places for whatever traps you decide to use, which monsters you will hire to face the heroes, and what treasures await those skilled enough to claim victory. Dungeon Tycoon is all about capitalizing on every second of every hero’s adventure in your mighty dungeon. Witchfire\nLure adventurers into your evil dungeon by summoning mighty foes, building huge and curious rooms, and a maze of deceptive opportunities. Watch how they perform and optimize every inch of your genius design. Ensure they don’t go back empty-handed, so they keep coming back.",
