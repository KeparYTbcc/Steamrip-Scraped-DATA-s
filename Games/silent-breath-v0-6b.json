    "description": "“Silent Breath” is a horror experience powered by Unreal Engine 5. Featuring photorealistic graphics, fully dynamic scares and microphone detection. Moonlighter\nYou find yourself in the middle of a mysterious forest. Your goal is to find people who have previously gotten lost in the forest. You must be SILENT at night because the forest is listening to your voice through your microphone as you explore. It tries to make you SCREAM with various jumpscares .\nWhen you scream , you get one step closer to losing. You also have to constantly check your surroundings because real threats that are trying to hunt you down are on your tail. You lose when you scream or get caught by threats, and the game restarts, but this time the locations of the previously found lost people have also changed. You can’t even predict what fear the game will throw at you at any given time because the whole process is randomized.",
