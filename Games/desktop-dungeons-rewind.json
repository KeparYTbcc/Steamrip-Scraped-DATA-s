    "description": "Desktop Dungeons: Rewind is a modern remastering of the award-winning, bite-sized, tactical dungeon crawler. Founding a new kingdom isn’t easy it takes cunning, manpower, and lots and lots of gold. How will you pay for the outrageously overpriced taverns and banks? Better descend into the dungeons and steal riches from the deadly inhabitants any way you can. Heal by exploring Reveal hidden terrain to regain health and mana.\nBut plan your route carefully or you’ll have nothing left to face the final enemy. Discover everything that earned Desktop Dungeons a cult following: innovative game design, hundreds of hours of content, daily online challenges, the amazing soundtrack by Danny Baranowsky and Grant Kirkhope, all the DLC, and more.
