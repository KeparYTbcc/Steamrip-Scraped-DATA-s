    "description": "Come to see what all this is about, have you? Right then, I’ll fill you in. The Deadly Path is a thrilling building management and roguelike real-time strategy game. It’s down to you to do some serious grovelling, gathering and building if you want to survive it. See, you’re the Custodian, and you’re in the bad books with the fearsome gods of the Dread Pantheon who you’re trapped here with. Drive Beyond Horizons\nIf you ever want to see the dim light of day again, you’ll need to keep these Dread Deities sweet. And that means bringing about their rightful ascension by whatever means necessary.\nAnyway, down here in this grimly fascinating fantasy underworld, you’ve got to flex your strategic muscles. The Deadly Path’s got an easy-to-pick-up but tricky-to- master game loop; the gods aren’t planning on making it easy for you.\nStill, it’s not all stick and no carrot . You’ll get to dote on different dastardly deities, construct wicked dungeon defences, and gather vital and vile materials. You know, for upgrades, sacrificial rituals, demonstrating your devotion, all the usual demonic deeds.\nAs you expand your burgeoning empire of darkness, you’ll usher in new eras of progress and help the Dread Pantheon out on their quest for revenge. Oh, and you get to micromanage a whole gamut of rancid but otherwise dutiful servants. Sounds fun, eh?",
