These winding tracks are treacherous, so you’ll need to plan each mission carefully. Be wary when traveling on foot, or switching the track’s direction; Charles might be waiting for you.\nGo looting or complete missions to find “Scraps”, which can be used to turn your train into a death machine on wheels. Help out the settlers in return for high powered weapons, and other items vital to Charles’ destruction . Complete the main questline, and summon Charles to a mortal duel. If you’ve gained enough strength, firepower, and skill, Charles may finally meet his match. American Hero",
