    "description": "Unleaving takes its title from Gerard Manley Hopkins ‘ poem: ‘Spring and Fall: To a Young Child.’ NightFeed It opens with the lines: ‘Márgarét, áre you gríeving Over Goldengrove unleaving?’ In Hopkins’ words, as the seasons change, ‘Goldengrove’ loses its leaves, is a metaphor for the transient nature of life. Unleaving is a metaphorical game crafted through illustrations and puzzles context.\nArt Experience Unleaving is as much a video game as it is an extended series of multimedia paintings and drawings. Every frame is a hand- painting , seamlessly integrating pencil and graphite puzzle elements. The visuals come to life through traditional painting animation. Embracing a commitment to originality, each scene is new, with no repetition. Each chapter is based on a specific theme that guides the mood, emotion, and story and, by extension, influences the colors and style.\nStory Driven Puzzles Through the gameplay featuring puzzles and skill-based challenges each tightly knit into the story’s fabric, players immerse themselves in the artistic experience.",
