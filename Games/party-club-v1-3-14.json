    "description": "Play solo or with up to 4 friends in couch mode or online co-op mode, and turn your venue into the hottest spot in the region. Greet customers at the door, choose their seats, and manage their satisfaction. If someone’s too much to handle, you can always give them the boot —literally Timo Boll Beats Table Tennis\nBE AWARE OF CUSTOMER TYPES\nYour customers are animals with unique personalities and seating preferences. Be careful—seating a panda next to a tiger might not end well!\nYou better watch out for special customers, while some may involuntarily release gas and knock you out, others may try to knock you out with old methods.\nSet up tables, juice machines, and even toilets wherever you like! Make purchases at the end of each day and strategize your layout to handle the flow of customers and challenges .",
