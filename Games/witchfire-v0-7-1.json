    "description": "Witchfire is a single-player RPG shooter from the creative minds behind Painkiller and Bulletstorm. Embark on perilous expeditions, vanquishing foes to enhance your powers and arsenal. Scavenge valuable resources and retreat to your sanctuary, or push your luck by confronting Familiars — the powerful guardians of the witch.\nSkill and knowledge are essential for success against the Witch of the Black Sea and her witchfire -fueled army. If you die, return to the battlefield for a one-time chance to reclaim what you lost, or attack again with a new plan.\nExplore vast, immersive biomes and choose your battleground to confront the witch’s forces. Each completed encounter strengthens you and your arsenal through the roguelite system called Arcana . There are countless ways to build your preyer and dominate the witch. Hard Time III\nOnly the most wicked sinners are transformed into preyers, undead assassins sustained by witchfire flowing through their veins. In the base of operations known as the Hermitory, you can choose from a wide selection of distinctive weapons, spells, and artifacts to build your own preyer .",
