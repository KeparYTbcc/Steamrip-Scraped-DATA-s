    "description": "Get Breathedge for free instantly and play pre-installed on SteamRiP all indie games with latest updates\nBreathedge is an ironic outer space survival adventure game. Take on the role of a simple guy called the Man who is just carrying his grandpa’s ashes to a galactic funeral and suddenly finds himself in the middle of a universal conspiracy. A massive space hearse suffers a wreck in the deep space , leaving the area filled with debris, coffins, dead passengers and yourself.\nSurvive in this interstellar dump, uncover a global conspiracy, save the princess and don’t break your fingers while tapping the keyboard as you travel around the world (keeping your display on for full immersion is advised). Space isn’t a joke (despite us trying to prove otherwise) and not dying is a challenge. Lose your progress in spectacular ways, including but not limited to suffocation, freezing, incineration, electrocution , depression, blunt trauma, and more.",
