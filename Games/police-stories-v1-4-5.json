    "description": "Inspired by SWAT 4 and gritty police TV shows, Police Stories is a fresh take on top-down shooters with an emphasis on tactics that forces you to make split second decisions. Neutralize criminals, rescue civilians and defuse bombs in Single Player mode or Online Co-op.\nAnd remember shooting first is not an option. Unforgiving and tense, each mission tells a story of two police operatives John Rimes and Rick Jones, filled with infiltrating gang hideouts, rescuing hostages , making arrests and other life-threatening situations.",
