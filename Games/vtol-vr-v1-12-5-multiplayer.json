    "description": "VTOL VR is a near-futuristic combat flight game built specifically for Virtual Reality. Pilot advanced multi-role jets, using your hands to flip switches, press buttons, and manipulate the virtual flight controls. Take on a wide array of challenges that will put your flight skills, situational awareness, and combat tactics to the test. No extra hardware is required. LEGO Star Wars: The Complete Saga\nIf you have a VR set with tracked controllers, then you have a virtual cockpit where you can reach out and interact with the stick and throttle, flip switches, press buttons, and even pull the eject handle if things go wrong. Immerse yourself in action packed combat missions, delicate vertical landings, aircraft carrier operations, aerial refueling and more. Create and fly custom missions which you can share with other pilots using the built-in mission editor and map editor.",
