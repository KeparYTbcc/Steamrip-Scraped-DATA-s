    "description": "The End Is Nigh is a sprawling adventure platformer where the player takes control over Ash, one of few “things” that have “survived” the “end of the world”. Follow Ash as he flops his way through a future of pain and suffering. Feel his stress levels rise as you throw him into an endless swarm of decaying, mutant animal -like creatures and help aid his final epic quest to simply make a friend (out of pieces of people he finds along his journey).\nOh, also you collect video game cartridges and tumors! if that does anything for ya. State of Decay 2",
