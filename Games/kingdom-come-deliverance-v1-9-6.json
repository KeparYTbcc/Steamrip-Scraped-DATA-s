With no king on the throne, Sigismund is now free to plunder Bohemia and seize its riches.\nIn the midst of this chaos, you’re Henry, the son of a blacksmith . Your peaceful life is shattered when a mercenary raid, ordered by King Sigismund himself, burns your village to the ground. By bittersweet fortune, you are one of the few survivors of this massacre .\nWithout a home, family, or future you end up in the service of Lord Radzig Kobyla, who is forming a resistance against the invasion. Fate drags you into this bloody conflict and shoves you into a raging civil war, where you help fight for the future of Bohemia.",
