    "description": "The Longest Road on Earth is a deeply personal and Loop Hero narrative title. Play in the songs of four short stories featuring stripped down mechanics and no words. Each story is up for interpretation – what story lives inside you for each character and the world around them? Be swept away by the haunting and sentimental lyrics of over twenty-four original, emotionally charged songs, sung by one of the developers.\nWalking down The Longest Road on Earth will only take you two hours, and it’s worth every step. An original, intimate soundtrack with themes and lyrics that seek the serenity and simplicity of life is included in each ticket to ride on The Longest Road on Earth. Feelings, emotions , situations, and perceptions that aren’t extraordinary yet define us as human beings, our stories , and how we share our lives with each other.",
