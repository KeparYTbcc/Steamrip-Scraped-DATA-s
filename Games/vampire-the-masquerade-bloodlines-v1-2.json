    "description": "Vampire®: The Masquerade-Bloodlines delivers a new type of RPG experience-one that blends all the core elements of a traditional RPG with the graphical richness, immediacy and brutal combat of a first-person action game. The game plunges players into the dark and gritty vampire underworld of modern-day L.A. as a creature of the night. Talk to Strangers\nPlayers will develop their character’s powers, interact with other characters and embark on story-driven quests as they battle mortals and other vampires with an incredible array of vampire powers and weapons. Powered by Valve’s Source Technology, the game is based on White Wolf’s popular Vampire: The Masquerade pen-and-paper RPG series and its official clans.",
