    "description": "Embrace the horrors of Banban’s Kindergarten. Delve even deeper into the depths of the establishment that was left suspiciously empty. Try to survive the unexpected residents and continue the search for your child. The depths of the mysterious establishment that is Banban’s Kindergarten turned out to be much bigger than anyone could have thought, with many floors having been built underneath the seemingly innocent Kindergarten explored in the first game. Metal Mutation\nWith friends being present at every turn, you have no choice but to continue delving deeper into the place in hopes of finding your child. Despite the number of opportunities you have had to make friends, you still fail every time. But with you delving even deeper into the establishment, perhaps you will find more success down in the lower levels. In Banban’s Kindergarten, there are friends to be made in every corner",
