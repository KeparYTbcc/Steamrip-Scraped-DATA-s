Set your car the way it fits for your driving skills and racing conditions.\nRevhead is about to build and race with your dream car and while all of your racing skills will be required to beat others on a track, you also have to master mechanical skills to be able to fix, maintain or re-build your car. A real car is built up from thousands of components. Each connected to each-others and they are working together as a car.
