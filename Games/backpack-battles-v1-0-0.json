    "description": "Prepare your backpack! Buy rare and legendary items and organize them to make powerful builds. Then battle other players with it REMATCH\nIn Backpack Battles , you fight with your backpack full of items. It matters what you buy, and especially how you place it! The smarter you place your items, the stronger you will be\nItems come in different shapes, sizes, prices, and rarities. Combine them into even stronger equipment. Brew a powerful potion , craft a legendary weapon, or hatch a dragon friend\nYou play against real builds of other players. See what they came up with, and counter them.\nSee how good you are in Ranked mode! Or have a relaxing time in Casual mode. In both cases, take your time, as there are no timers at all\nChoose a class depending on your play style. Do you want heavy crits or poison damage over time?",
