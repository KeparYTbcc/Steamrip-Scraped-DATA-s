    "description": "In the space-colony simulation game Oxygen Not Included you’ll find that scarcities of oxygen, warmth and sustenance are constant threats to your colony’s survival. Guide colonists through the perils of subterranean asteroid living and watch as their population grows until they’re not simply surviving, but thriving. Everything in your space colony is under your control, from excavation and resource allocation right down to plumbing and power systems.\nResources will begin depleting with your first breath , however, so be sure to dig fast if you want to live. Keep the psychological impact of survival at bay with fun leisure activities, great accommodations and even better food for your colony. Duplicands each have different and potentially destructive ways of reacting to stress, so be sure to always keep them happy. Whatever the cost .",
