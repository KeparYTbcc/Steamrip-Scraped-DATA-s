    "description": "DON’T WATCH is a first-person psychological horror game from the intricate BrokenLore series. Shinji is a young hikikomori, trapped inside his small Tokyo apartment. With unpaid rent, mounting bills, and a family that doesn’t understand him, he feels isolated from the world—and from himself. Dimensionals\nHis only escape is video games, but even that can’t ease the crushing weight of his anxiety . You’ll explore Shinji’s mind as it unravels, but be cautious. Hyakume , a malevolent entity with a hundred eyes, is watching, waiting for the right moment to strike. Your PC is the only link to the outside world. But even there, safety is an illusion",
