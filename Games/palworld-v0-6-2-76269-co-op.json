    "description": "Q. What kind of game is this?\nA. In this game, you can peacefully live alongside mysterious creatures known as Pals or risk your life to drive off a ruthless poaching syndicate.\nPals can be used to fight, or they can be made to work on farms or factories .\nSurvival In a harsh environment where food is scarce and vicious poachers roam , danger waits around every corner. To survive, you must tread carefully and make difficult choices even if that means eating your own Pals when the time comes. Three Kingdoms Zhao Yun\nMounts & Exploration Pals can be mounted to traverse the land, sea and sky—allowing you to traverse all kinds of environment as you explore the world.\nBuilding Structures Want to build a pyramid? Put an army of Pals on the job. Don’t worry; there are no labor laws for Pals.\nProduction Make use of Pals and their skills to make fire, generate electricity, or mine ore so that you can live a life of comfort.\nFarming Some Pals are good at planting seeds, while others are skilled at watering or harvesting crops. Work together with your Pals to create an idyllic farmstead.\nFactories & Automation Letting Pals do the work is the key to automation. Build a factory, place a Pal in it, and they’ll keep working as long as they’re fed—until they’re dead, that is.",
