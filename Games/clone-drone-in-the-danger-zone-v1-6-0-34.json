    "description": "Clone Drone in the Danger Zone is an interesting and rather unusual fighting game in which players are invited to take up a sword and go to the arena in a robot’s body in order to declare war on all other robots located there In fact, the game does not offer anything fundamentally new, but at the same time it is not a clone of any other. Here you are an ordinary drone with a lightsaber in hand.\nAll you have to do is defeat the rest of the drones in the arena. But it’s not that easy. Not only do all drones have unique skills, but the arenas themselves are quite dangerous . Take control of the drone and go to the arena. Drones- judges will comment on your every step here, and it’s fun, believe me. Opponents can come across, both the same, equal in strength, and a little more pumped .",
