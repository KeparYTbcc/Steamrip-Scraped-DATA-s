    "description": "You’re Grandma. You’ve got a to-do list, a surprise babysitting gig, and absolutely no idea what’s going on. That’s a dangerous combo. Grandma, No!\nIn Grandma, No!, you’ll wobble through three sandbox -y areas, poke everything that looks pokeable, and try to get stuff done-until it explodes, runs away, or turns into a sentient sandwich. Each “simple” task turns into a ridiculous 2D minigame, followed by more wandering, more weirdness , and more characters who definitely need therapy. Taking out the trash may lead you somewhere unexpected, and cooking dinner could end up with more fire than flavour. Just when things start to calm down, BOOM — something weirder crashes the party.",
