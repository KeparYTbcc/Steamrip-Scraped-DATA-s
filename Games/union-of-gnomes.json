Embark on the challenging journey to lead the gnome’s uprising, stand against Snow White’s oppressive rule, assemble your liberation forces, and bring freedom to this land. Car Dealer Simulator\nFree your gnome comrades to bolster your squad with the best freedom fighters. Experiment with the lineup to reveal powerful synergies and combos with 130 cards that will either hit, poison, weaken, blind your enemies, or get your gnomes drunk\nPick one of three plucky gnome heroes with unique traits, distinctive decks, and special abilities to slay the slavers. Enhance them between game runs to perfect your build.\nTake down the ferocious enemies from different fairy tales, including the Red Hood, Wizard of Oz, Pinocchio, or Snow White herself.
