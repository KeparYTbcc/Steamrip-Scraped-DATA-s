    "description": "Indiana Jones and the Great Circle’s story sees the Marshall College professor thrust into a globe-trotting adventure to solve a complex mystery . While it’s not worth spoiling the ins and outs of the Great Circle’s core narrative, I was thoroughly immersed in uncovering the whys of it all. The story and the sequences do defy logic (and physics) more than the movies might, but it still feels like a true Indiana Jones experience, right down to the red line moving across a map signifying a change in location. SILENT BREATH\nThe Great Circle’s narrative stands on its own but it’s made even better thanks to the cast and performances. Troy Baker is, oftentimes , uncanny as Indiana Jones, doing his best to represent the tone and mannerisms of Harrison Ford. There are times when the performance skirts dangerously close to imitation, but it is handled with a reverence for the character (and the actor) that ensures Indiana Jones and the Great Circle doesn’t feel like a knock-off. Everyone else in the cast is equally great, but as with any great Indiana Jones tale, the supporting players are what truly make each adventure sing.\nAlessandra Mastronardi’s Gina Lombardi is a fantastic companion for Indiana Jones, giving Baker someone to play off of and to offer the outsider’s perspective on this world. The late Tony Todd turns in a performance that, on the surface, might seem one-note but becomes more nuanced as the plot develops. And Marios Gavrilis as Emmerich Voss is such a great, scenery-chewing villain – the perfect adversary for Indiana Jones.\nNormally, story and performance might not get so much attention in a game review, but Indiana Jones and the Great Circle deserves the extra praise. There are so many cutscenes in the game (more than MachineGames has ever done) that the story and acting pull a lot of weight alongside the gameplay . If this were just an Indiana Jones movie, I think fans would be very satisfied with the experience.",
