    "description": "Welcome to Pizza Hero, the exciting new shoot ’em up roguelite that puts a delicious twist on the genre! In this game, you’ll play as a brave pizza who must defend the world from an invasion of enemies.\nAs you battle your way through the game, you’ll have the opportunity to choose from a variety of different toppings that will grant you special abilities. For example, selecting pepperoni will give you a grenade, allowing you to deal splash damage. Or, if you’re feeling saucy, you can choose blue cheese to create a pungent perimeter around your pizza , damaging any foes that come too close. Fate/stay night REMASTERED\nPizza Hero is a swarm survivor, meaning that you’ll need to use all of your skills and strategies to take down waves of relentless enemies. With randomly generated levels and power-ups, no two playthroughs are ever the same. To help you in your quest , the game features an auto-rotate feature that allows you to easily switch between targeting groups without having to manually rotate.",
