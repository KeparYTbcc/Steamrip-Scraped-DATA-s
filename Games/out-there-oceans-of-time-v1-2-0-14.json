    "description": "The successor to the award-winning Out There, Oceans of Time blends roguelike, resource management and interactive fiction for a space survival epic where death is one wrong decision away. As Commander Nyx, explore a vast galaxy that is different every time you play, as you search for the Archon; a cosmic villain set on dominating the civilisations of the galaxy.\nEncounter other strange lifeforms and learn to communicate, trade, and conduct diplomacy as you build a coalition of allies in your mission to find the Archon. Recruit new members from the alien races you cross paths with, and build a team capable of traversing the cosmos.\nManage your crew, your ship and its systems; the mission’s success is down to your decisions as Commander. Experience a deep, branching narrative written by FibreTigre, dialogue by Christos Gage (Daredevil (Netflix, 2015), Spider-Man (Insomniac, Sony, 2018)) and beautiful interactive cutscenes illustrated by renowned artist Benjamin Carré (Transformers: Age of Extinction, Alone in the Dark). Out There: Oceans of Time is developed by Mi-Clos Studio, the creators of Out There and Sigma Theory.",
