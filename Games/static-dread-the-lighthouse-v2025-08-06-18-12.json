    "description": "In the aftermath of a global cataclysm , the harbor authorities reactivated an ancient lighthouse, hoping to keep the seas navigable amidst the growing chaos . A lone keeper is dispatched to the forsaken island, tasked with manning the beacon. The fate of passing vessels and the nearby town now rests in his hands. Far away, a wife and daughter wait for his return. Is This Seat Taken?\nEach night, his duties grow more perilous . Mariners report encounters with creatures beyond the reach of science. Ships drift back from distant waters – empty, their crews vanished without a trace. In the island’s fishing village, the locals whisper prayers to sea gods and perform rituals to raise the dead .\nWill the keeper preserve his sanity, protect those he loves , and guide the vessels entrusted to him through the abyss? Or will he, too, be lost to the dark tides gathering beneath the surface of the world?",
