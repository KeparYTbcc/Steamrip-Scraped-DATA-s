    "description": "Get Night Book PC game for free instantly and play pre-installed on SteamRiP\nAn online interpreter is tricked into reading an ancient book that summons a demon into her home. Night Book is an interactive occult thriller from the publishers of The Complex, Five Dates and Maid of Sker. Loralyn works the night shift remotely from her home, live interpreting video calls from English to French and back again. Currently pregnant, with a husband working distant and caring for her unsound father, she is desperately trying to stay her family together and safe – but who is she prepared to sacrifice to survive? The fiancé, the baby, her father or herself? Fans of prior Wales games will know the score right away; you watch high-definition video footage unfold while periodically responding to typically one among two branching decisions, each offering up either distinct or mild variations to the continued story.",
