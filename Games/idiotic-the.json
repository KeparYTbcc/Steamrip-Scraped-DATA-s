    "description": "IDIOTIC is a fast-paced single-player FPS where you can switch between alternate dimensions at will. Wreak chaos and improve your character as you move at break-neck speed. As you are torn between the fractures of reality, you can switch between The Top and The Alt. Industries of Titan\nThe Top has your “normal” reality with flying, deadly robots , and people in suits trying to kill you, but also has the rewards and objectives. The Alt is a darker, deadlier version of the top with corrupted zombies and the Neon Stringler trying to kill you, but you can regain health and reposition from The Top there.\nUse them both to achieve your goals. Wallrun , double jump and slide around in procedural levels Every game mode requires the need to use your advanced movement and your dimension switching abilities. Raid the ever-changing city and cause chaos. But if you’re not fast enough, you’ll find chaos upon you too.\nEach are fit for a different playstyle, with their own Temporary Boosts you can find across the map.
