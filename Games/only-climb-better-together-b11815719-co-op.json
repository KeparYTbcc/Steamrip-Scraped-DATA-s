    "description": "Only Climb: Better Together is an engaging multiplayer game that combines elements of a platformer. You have to climb up to the sky, overcoming various platforms and objects to uncover the mystery of this puzzling world. Play alone or with friends, because it’s always more fun together. Compete, co-operate and overcome all obstacles together, climbing to the top. You will find entertaining Easter eggs and references along the way.\nBe cautious and alert, because every item may turn out to be unpredictable , even if it behaved differently before. The absence of a save function adds to the difficulty of getting through the game. You won’t get a second chance. Even the slightest wrong step can send you back to the very beginning. Sometimes it can be difficult for children to realise how wide the world outside their home is. Find out what lies beyond the fence of their junkyard and feel the world inviting you to explore it NARUTO SHIPPUDEN: Ultimate Ninja STORM 2\nLike fledglings leaving their nests, you will need courage and perseverance to overcome your fears and reach your goals. The world, my friend, is far from paradise or a walk in a sunny meadow. It is a dangerous and steep place where, if you give in for even a moment, it will knock you down with such a bang that you will never rise again. No one on this earth gives such a slap as life does. It’s important to take the blow from fate and get up. If you intend to keep going, don’t give up halfway through. That is how victory is won, no matter the odds",
