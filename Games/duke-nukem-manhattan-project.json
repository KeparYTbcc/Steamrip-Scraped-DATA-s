    "description": "Playing Duke Nukem: Manhattan Project is like digging up a time capsule with buried treasures only to find out what people in the past considered valuable is now garbage. Labyrinthine\nUnlike the popular Duke Nukem 3D, Manhattan Project is not a FPS. Instead what you get for your hard-earned cash is a poorly-aged side-scrolling shooter originally released in 2002, with all the mediocre 3D graphics we used to kind of think were awesome. Even worse are Duke’s animations , which give off the vague implication that Duke’s been shoving his foot up his own ass instead of those of his foes.\nYeah, Manhattan Project is ugly, but that wouldn’t be a big deal if it were fun. It’s not. Each level of the game boils down to finding a bomb (wrapped, of course, around a woman with gigantic breasts), finding a key, and shooting a few enemies along the way. Combat is boring, usually boiling down to just firing periodically at the edge of the screen (though you can’t fire at angles , only horizontally and vertically). The only real exceptions to this are boss fights, which occur after every few stages and mostly require you to simply fire at one weak spot a lot. How exciting. Maybe this repetitive level design was passable at the turn of the millennia, but it’s downright mind-numbing now.\nDuke’s personality has also grown tiring. The chauvinistic , all-things-manly dialogue of Duke occasionally elicited a smile, but what was hilarious a decade ago sounds mostly idiotic now. Duke’s jokes are stale, delivered poorly, and immature in a way that even someone like me, who still laughs at farts, can no longer appreciate .",
