    "description": "Well, to say Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown story is wafer-thin is an insult to the strength of a wafer. Essentially, you are invited to the Solar Crown motorsport festival in Hong Kong, and after a few practice races in a sweet Lambo, you are then dumped in the open world proper with your basic car, and off you go. You compete in races, pass through speed traps and other collectibles to increase your reputation , unlock the next area, and do the same. Keylocker\nSo, how is the actual racing? In a nutshell, it’s abysmal. Yes, the actual driving is, at best, okay and does the job, but the cars never take any damage, no matter how hard you smash into other cars or the environment . There is no difficulty slider, so you have no way of knowing whether you are driving against an 80-year-old pensioner or Max Verstappen , and unless you know each race layout perfectly, the opposition will trounce you without much fuss.\nI would care about winning each race if the rewards the game gives you were worth it. In one race, I finished fifth but still got a lot of XP and credits. I thought, “Let’s try and win it.” Eventually, I did, only to see the difference in XP and credits is minimal at best.",
