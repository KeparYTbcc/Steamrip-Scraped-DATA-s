    "description": "and Roger is an interactive novel that lets you see through the protagonist’s eyes—whether what she sees makes sense or not. It is comprised of three chapters and can be played in its entirety in about one hour.\nIt’s just another morning for this young girl. She wakes up and starts getting herself ready while shaking off the sleepiness like always. Except something, somehow, feels off. When she steps into the living room, she expects to find her dad preparing for work. Instead, she finds a stranger sleeping on the couch. The man wakes up, looks at the girl, and sighs. Ignoring her confusion, he mumbles to himself with a hint of sadness in his voice .",
