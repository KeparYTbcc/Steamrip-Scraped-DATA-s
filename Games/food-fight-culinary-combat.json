    "description": "Food Fight: Culinary Combat is a third-person shooter based on the classic Atari game Food Fight. Charley Chuck is back, and this time the world is bigger and better than ever before. Enter the Atariverse, where you’ll meet developers of the original Food Fight, as well as characters from classic Atari games like Centipede, Yars’ Revenge, and more! You can also practice your skills at the shooting range, check out Atari artifacts in the museum, or head over to Antonio’s for a slice. The real meat of this feast is the combat.\nFill your fork with multiple game modes, like the winner takes all Buffet Brawl, or the floor-destroying Crumbling mode. That’s not all! Find circuit boards to unlock fully playable Atari arcades. Get new outfits for your characters and customize their look. Climb your way to the top of the leaderboards to prove you’re the head chef in the kitchen! This is Food Fight like you’ve never seen it before",
