    "description": "In Guilty as Sock!, it’s a free-for-all with your friends! The prosecutor throws wild accusations, and with your evidence cards, you’ll either defend yourself or roast the accused. The judge? Just trying (and probably failing) to keep things under control as chaotic lawyers yell their way to victory. Lawyer or prosecutor? Grab your evidence cards and twist the story to your advantage!\nWant to throw your opponent off their game? Talk over them, toss paper balls, mock them—whatever it takes to sway the verdict in your favor! Chaos is the law here.",
