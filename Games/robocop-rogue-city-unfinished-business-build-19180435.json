    "description": "Following RoboCop’s decisive victory over Detroit’s gangs, a new chapter unfolds in this standalone extension set after the events of RoboCop: Rogue City.\nThe New Guy in Town has been defeated, but the streets are still riddled with crime. A spark of hope comes from OCP’s latest project: OmniTower – a massive housing complex designed specifically to provide for the needs of the residents of Old Detroit.\nBut when a group of highly trained mercenaries armed with cutting-edge weapons takes control of the building and turns it into their deadly fortress, RoboCop must take action to put a stop to their plans and uphold the law.\nPrepare to take on a new breed of enemies: OmniTower is packed with high-tech threats.\nFrom flying drones to exploding bots and anti-personnel turrets, every floor is riddled with deadly traps, and heavily armed elite troops. Expect to face minigun-toting armoured squads, special forces equipped with jet packs or even katana-wielding foes who look more machine than man.\nWhen it’s too late to shout “”freeze””, you can rely on RoboCop’s arsenal to cool down enemies’ ambitions. Choose from a wide range of powerful weapons to serve Justice, including the iconic Auto-9 or the all-new Cryo Cannon. Unleash RoboCop’s unmatched strength to deliver devastating finishing moves – whether smashing an opponent’s skull against a concrete wall or into the nearest drinks vending machine.\nExperience unique missions with familiar faces which reveal more of the storyline of Unfinished Business.\nBefore becoming RoboCop, he was plain old police officer Alex Murphy, brave and resolute, but all too vulnerable on the beat in Old Detroit. Discover a different side of the legendary law enforcer, voiced by Peter Weller.\nStep into the big boots of ED-209 and make the mercs know the efficiency of the iconic urban pacifier in action. This time, criminals won’t have 20 seconds to comply. The Walking Dead: A New Frontier",
