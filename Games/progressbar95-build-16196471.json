    "description": "Progressbar95 is a unique indie game with a strong nostalgic vibe. It turns vintage GUI elements like panels, buttons and icons into game elements! Fights against virtual office assistants, calculators, annoying pop-ups and maddening visual glitches. Use a terminal to hack thing and search for bonuses. The game will make you smile!",
