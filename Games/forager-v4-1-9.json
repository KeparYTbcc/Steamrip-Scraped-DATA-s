    "description": "Forager is a 2D open world game inspired by exploration, farming and crafting games such as Stardew Valley , Terraria & Zelda. First, you will be engaged in gathering, then you can learn to hunt and fish, and then minerals from various caves and mines will become available to you. Learn to survive , get useful items and use them wisely, so much so that they bring you maximum benefit.\nBy the way, in Forager, rare resources and objects can be exhibited in the local museum – and for collecting a complete collection of one type or another, you can also get a serious reward. Traveling and mining is fun, but it’s not the only thing you can do here when you decide to download a Forager torrent in Russian from our website. You can grow vegetables, fruits and even flowers, engage in animal husbandry and raise sheep, and if you try hard, you can even figure out how to grow a gem or some rare mineral with your own hands.",
