    "title": "Sons of Valhalla",
    "description": "Sons of Valhalla combines side-scrolling combat with base-building strategy in a beautiful pixel-art Viking Age world. You play as Thorald Olavson, a warrior hell-bent on tracking down the Jarl who burned down his home, kidnapped his beloved, and fled to distant Beat Slayer.\nRaise a warband , establish strongholds, and personally lead your troops in a grand saga of vengeance. Across the North Sea, far from home, you must first establish a stronghold from which to begin your assault. Hunting your nemesis down will take resources, soldiers, and strategic thinking. Manage a growing economy, establish siege camps and training grounds, raise a massive host, and raid neighboring villages to bolster your resources and push your enemy back.",
