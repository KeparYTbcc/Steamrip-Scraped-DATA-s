    "description": "We’ve temporarily removed showing ‘Spanish – Latin America ‘ as a supported language on the store page, but worry not if you’re from that region . We’ll be adding support in a post-launch patch as a free update, so you will still be able to enjoy the game in your chosen language.\nFrom the creative minds behind Persona 3, 4, and 5 comes Metaphor: ReFantazio, a unique fantasy world, where your protagonist will journey alongside his fairy companion , Gallica, to lift the curse from the kingdom’s lost prince. Control your destiny, face your fears and awaken magical “Archetype” powers that lie dormant in your heart. By awakening to an “Archetype,” you will unlock the power to channel and combine the abilities of unique job classes. Strengthen your bonds and build your party to take down powerful foes and discover the kingdom’s true nature. The Holy Gosh Darn",
