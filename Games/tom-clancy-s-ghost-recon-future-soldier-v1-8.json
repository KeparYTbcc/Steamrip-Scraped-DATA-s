    "description": "WHEN YOU’RE OUTNUMBERED…ONLY THE DEAD FIGHT FAIR. NightClub Simulator\nThere is nothing fair, honorable, or just about combat. There is only winning and losing—the dead and the living. The Ghosts don’t worry about even odds. They do everything in their power to overwhelm and obliterate the enemy. Future technology is the key to winning an asymmetric battle.\nIn Ghost Recon Future Soldier join an elite team of highly trained, cut-throat special-ops soldiers. Tag ‘em and bag ‘em: Use the tagging feature on the ground or by drone to coordinate synchronized attacks on enemy targets. Stay out of enemy sight: Exploit unique cover system and swap through dynamic covers to surprise, flank and eliminate the enemies.",
