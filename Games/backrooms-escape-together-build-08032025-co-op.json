Currently, Level 0 is the only playable level. Being an introduction, your team is tasked with various research objectives.\nThese can include recording entities and landmarks, gathering data on the backrooms, and collecting VHS tapes for evidence Built in Unreal Engine 5, Backrooms : Escape Together will be the first to truly capture the essence of the Backrooms. Bendy and the Dark Revival\nLevels will be procedurally generated, dynamically lit with stunning quality, and packed with detail. Levels will be added constantly through early access as we grow the game into the true Backrooms experience.
