After waking up in the middle of the night to mysterious sounds, you start exploring the dark looking for comfort. The game explores horror through atmosphere and exploration, not with scores and combat systems.\nIn Among the Sleep you’re vulnerable , scared, and trying to make sense of the world. In the story, you will play as a little girl whose mother has not lived with her father for a long time. And so, the next birthday ended not at all the way the main character would like. She was waiting for her dad, but her mother did not let him go to her daughter – all the girl received was a teddy bear, which in the end turned out to be very difficult. He is alive, talking, and ready to follow his mistress wherever he goes.",
