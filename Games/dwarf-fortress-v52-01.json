    "description": "The legendary Dwarf Fortress is now on Steam. Build a fortress and try to help your dwarves survive, despite threats of starvation, dragons, and madness. In this complex construction/management/roguelike simulation, every generated world brings a unique challenge , whether it’s dwarves with their own simulated personalities or aquifers. Fantasy Farming: Orange Season\nObserve what makes your civilization fall into eventual decline, and learn for next time until something else inevitably goes wrong It’s difficult to convey the depth of the generation. Hundreds of animals and monsters, many of which are randomly created for each world, as well as generated poetry, musical forms, instruments, and dances for your dwarves to practice and perform. A dynamic weather model tracks wind, humidity, and air masses to create fronts, clouds, storms, and blizzards . Over two hundred rock and mineral types can appear, in their proper geological environments.\nNothing substantial is new or changed, under the hood. It’s still good old Dwarf Fortress , but with graphics support and music by default. A few bells and whistles won’t change that. You may already be familiar with the tile set mod packs from Michał “Mayday” Madej and Jacob “Ironhand” Bowman .\nTogether, their efforts are creating an all-new tileset featuring brand new pixel art by artists Carolyn Jong and Neoriceisgood . Dwarf Fortress Steam edition will have a 15 track soundtrack by Dabu, Simon Swerwer and Águeda Macias including tracks in the Dwarvish language. It’s never been easier to start playing! We’ve improved the new player experience with the addition of tutorials to guide you through building your first fort and keeping your dwarves happy .",
