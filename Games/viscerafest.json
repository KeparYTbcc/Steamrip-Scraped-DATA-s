    "description": "Viscerafest is a sci-fi fantasy single-player arena FPS where you take the role of Caroline, a bloodthirsty, psychopathic mercenary who wants nothing more than to marry her wonderful boyfriend, Athens Fetter. The problem is money’s tight, and rings aren’t exactly cheap. But thankfully, there may yet be hope for her, as a warlock named Cromune has acquired a rather hefty bounty on his head. HOLE\nBringing his corpse in to the respective authorities won’t be an easy task however, as Cromune has a small army defending him. Forces from the U.S.C. (United Scientific Conglomerate) led by Dr Mortice stand shoulder to shoulder with the religious zealot . But what’s a few hundred soldiers to death incarnate? Nothing but a slaughter Nay A Viscerafest!",
