In order to save your friends, you enter the Otherworld, a Daemon-filled dimension beyond the real world. Who Must Die\nWithin this enigmatic realm, you must learn to harness your Authority of Vanity and conjure a battalion of Fiends, whose power comes from the Ego of their master . Develop your Ego through various psychological tests to enhance the power of your Fiends, and lead your forces into battle to fight with and against the seven “ Pactbearers ” that are corrupting the academy.\nEmbrace the power of your madness to gain strength, but take care not to delve too far, lest you risk losing yourself. Fellow students and instructors will lend you their aid in your quest to resolve the anomalies throughout the campus.",
