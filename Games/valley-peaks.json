    "description": "Escape the daily grind and journey to Valley Peaks where you can soak in the serene mountain landscape, set in a miniature open world. Climb Mount Shroom, the tallest point in Valley Peaks, or take a stroll through Roston Ranch where the geese may even let you pet them Lost Castle 2\nBetween climbing sessions you can get cozy with colorful froggy friends and enjoy minigames like Mortimer’s Boat Race or head to Bone Hill and partake in a Pumpkin Hunt! Or even explore the world collecting Golden Mushrooms – they gotta be used for something right?\nPeak Performance Challenge yourself to a new climbing mechanic that tasks you with honing your skills to overcome various challenges, such as swinging spikes, prickly vines, and much more. Don’t worry – if a frog can do it – you can too!\nGo Go Gadget Unlock an array of gadgets, including a Glider that lets you soar from one peak to another or a Specialized Tongue to help you stick to those hard to reach spots. We don’t recommend trying to talk when you’ve got a mouthful of mountain though. Use with caution.\nHighland High-Fives Valley Peaks is created and developed by Thomas Crowe and Jack Chateau-Loney, two Scots passionate about frogs. “We are excited for players to hop in and embrace the froggy lifestyle. Because let’s face it – life’s too short to NOT be a frog",
