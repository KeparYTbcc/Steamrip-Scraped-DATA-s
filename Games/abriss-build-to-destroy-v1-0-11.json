    "description": "ABRISS is an atmospheric physics-destruction building game. Build structures from parts to let them crash into your targets. Unlock new parts, destroy more, witness entropy at its worst in digital-brutalist cityscapes. Build to destroy. Choose from parts with different weights, forms and functions to build a structure. Be creative and resourceful with the parts you get, try to destroy the target with less parts or in a more elegant way – it’s going to be a spectacle any way you do it. Dead Island\nTry to hit the main targets to win a level in campaign mode. Destroy an armored wall first so you can then shoot through the hole into the vulnerable center. Try to hit a bomb in the environment. Use environment mechanics like the giant Pistons to catapult Ultra Heavy Cubes into a target. Or just throw everything you have at your targets – that might just work too.",
