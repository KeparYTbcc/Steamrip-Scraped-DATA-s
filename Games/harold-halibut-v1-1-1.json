    "description": "Harold Halibut is a handmade narrative game about friendship and life on a city-sized spaceship submerged in an alien ocean. System Shock\nIt’s been 250 years since your home – an ark-like spaceship – fled an Earth on the verge of cold war to find a habitable planet to preserve the human race. You are Harold, a young lab assistant for the ship’s lead scientist, Jeanne Mareaux. While most of the ship’s inhabitants have reconciled themselves to a life lived aboard the sunken ship, Mareaux still works tirelessly to find a way for the ship to leave the planet and find a new, dryer home.\nBut the weird, wonderful and diverse people of the FEDORA I keep Harold busy too… Until one fateful encounter plunges Harold into a world no one could have imagined – and one that may hold the key to Mareaux’s re-launch plans. Join Harold as he explores a vibrant retro-future world in his quest to find the true meaning of ‘home’.",
