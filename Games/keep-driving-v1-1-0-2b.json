    "description": "A long, slow summer lies ahead. Hearing about a festival on the other side of the country, you fire up your engine, plot a course on your map, and hit the road. How, if you get there at all, is up to you. Procedurally generated pixel art open world Keep Driving is a management RPG about slowly making your way through a procedurally generated pixel art open world. SWORN\nPick up hitchhikers with their own personalities and stories; upgrade, customize and repair your car. Solve challenges on the road using a unique turn-based ‘combat’ system, using your own skills and whatever’s lying around in the glovebox to make it through.\nAt the end of your road trip, return back to the beginning and see what happens if you had followed a different path. There are multiple endings, with each taking about 1-4 hours to complete. Immerse yourself in the land through its highways, dirt tracks, and calm country roads. And remember to enjoy the ride. You’re young and don’t have much to lose.",
