Choose a survivor to set forth and explore the ruins of civilization, finding fuel to travel to new locations and gathering supplies to craft weapons and more.\nYou’ll need to stay on your toes, since hordes of zombies still roam the streets, and you’re no superhuman. In fact, you’re one of the infected yourself, and eventually you’ll die, be it from the hostile undead or the virus rampaging through your body. But when that happens, you’ll pick up the game again as a new survivor , with perks and upgrades earned based on your progress from the last, and set out to try again.",
