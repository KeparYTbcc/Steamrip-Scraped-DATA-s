    "description": "Being the captain of a spaceship can be hard, especially when there’s a price on your head. Bounty hunters, space pirates, and even the Galactic Union are trying to hunt you down. All that stands between you and oblivion is your wits, your crew, and your trusty ship. The Galactic Junkers is a comedic action-adventure space combat game that puts you in the role of a space captain on the run. Blasphemous\nYour ship might be falling apart and your crew isn’t the best but with a little luck you can keep everything ship-shape. Upgrade your ship, hire new crew, steal supplies and equipment, and keep searching for the truth of why everyone wants you dead. In the far future the Great Cataclysm saw Earth destroyed, seeing humanity throughout the Solar System. To survive we’ve become nomads , eking out a living on space stations that are falling apart and barely habitable asteroids.\nHumanity has lost hope but a few brave space captains are out there, trying to find a new future for us. You’re one of them, building a life full of adventure for you and your crew, with a full load of Space Munch, a moody computer and a barely functioning ship, what could possibly go wrong? Take a journey across the solar system exploring all nine planets and their neighboring sectors.\nDiscover mysterious asteroids, creaking space stations, abandoned shipwrecks, deadly pirates and much more. Running a spaceship is never easy and there’s always bills to pay. Keep your bank balance looking healthy by mining asteroids , salvaging derelicts, and trading with disreputable characters. Maybe you’ll even partake in a little theft, but don’t worry – we don’t tell anyone.",
