    "description": "This is an easy and funny sand sculpture game. Each level will provide a new environment for players to explore. Of course, the dreamer’s soft body and rocking movements don’t make things easy. Whether it’s jumping , climbing, loading or rocking, it’s easy to get worse very funny results. If the soft little man grabs the rope, his hand slips, his judgment of space is wrong, he jumps wrong, Ultimate Epic Battle Simulator or he is even pushed down from the edge of the cliff by his close teammates Don’t be afraid: he will just fall back into the dream and be ready to try again and again.",
