    "description": "Deathbound is a one-of-a-kind party-based soulslike set in a callous world where Faith and Science clash. The forbidden city of Akratya is an unforgiving land that cannot be conquered alone. Bind with fallen warriors found throughout your crusade and dynamically transform between the characters seamlessly mid-combat with the unique 4-hero party system.\nThe fallen are individual characters with their own unique skill sets, combat styles, and rich history. By absorbing their essence, you inherit the fiber of their very being. The characters’ conflicts and synergies greatly impact gameplay, so relationships must be balanced. Strong synergies may offer combat buffs that can spell disaster for the ruthless boss awaiting your steel and magic. SteamWorld Heist II\nThroughout combat , you will charge a sync meter shared across all the characters. During an opportune moment, dispel your sync meter and unleash a devastating Morphstrike using the combined power of the bound fallen warriors. When faced with a formidable abomination, a precisely executed Morphstrike can be the deciding factor between life and death\nThe world of Deathbound has been lovingly crafted and influenced by the developer’s homeland of Brazil, a vibrant culture brimming with life, creativity, rhythm, and a rich history. From the Afro-Brazilian martial art of Capoeira to the sweeping music cascading through Akratya, TrialForge’s origins shine throughout every aspect of Deathbound.",
