    "description": "Nuclear Option is a combat flight game set on a dynamic and realistic battlefield of the near future. Use an array of advanced weapons to change the course of battles as you intercept bombers , duel fighters, fly under the radar, or unleash the fury of nuclear weapons on enemy formations. Project Wingman\nEach aircraft comes with an immersive cockpit featuring a situational awareness HUD, identifying nearby targets and threats. Aircraft can be flown with various controllers or with a mouse-controlled “virtual joystick”, requiring no special hardware.\nExperience realistic flight dynamics , with stalls, spins and g-force effects fully implemented, as each aircraft is composed of up to 50 individually simulated physics parts . A highly detailed damage model means that the condition of each part affects the way your aircraft flies.\nBuild your own missions using the included mission editor, and then fly your mission solo or with friends in PVP or PVE multiplayer combat .",
