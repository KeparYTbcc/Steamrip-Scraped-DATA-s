    "description": "Set up your repair house just the way you like it. Layout your tools, unlock new equipment and expand the space to open up new restoration opportunities. Meticulously disassemble each accurately detailed item, locating individual components, removing the pieces, and carefully reassembling. Learn the restoration process, plan your execution, and perfect your craft. Wash away the dirt to restore the shimmer and shine to items as they have never been seen before. Feel the satisfaction as you sandblast away old paint from industrial antiques to reveal new gleaming metal below. Get creative with the painting station . Colour & spray your newly restored items however you wish. GoreBox",
