    "description": "Papetura is a handcrafted puzzle adventure game made entirely out of paper. Along with atmospheric music made by Floex, it creates a mysterious and unique paper world, shrouded in shadow and light. Papetura tells a story about lonely paper creature Pape, trapped in a flowery prison. One day Pape escapes and finds little Tura, a magical being that heâ€™ll take care of. Gloomwood\nTogether they will have to face dark and flaming monsters which will try to burn down their beloved paper world. The team consists of the creator Tomasz Ostafin (Petums), music artist Tomas Dvorak (Floex), and sound designer Juraj Mravec. The game was being made for many years, inspired by old classic games like The Neverhood, Machinarium, movies of studio Ghibli , and fascination with architecture and paper sculptures.",
