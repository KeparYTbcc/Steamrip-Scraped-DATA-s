    "description": "Manage the resources of a newly discovered planet. Bring supplies to the cities and manage its terraformation . Extract minerals, transform and transport them to the cities, so that they can expand and progress. Build terraforming devices, such as greenhouse gas factories, in order to progressively warm up the atmosphere, make the ice melt and make rain fall, until rivers and oceans form. Returnal\nThen, when the conditions are met, you will be able to plant trees and watch them grow into large forests . Plan B: Terraform is a calm and contemplative science-fiction game based on a credible near future. It also offers an educational approach to greenhouse effects and water cycle mechanisms . Earth has a very hard time limiting global warming and its catastrophic consequences. Humanity needs a plan B in order to ensure its survival. This is up to you",
