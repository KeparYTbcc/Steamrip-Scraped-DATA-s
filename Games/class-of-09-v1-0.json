    "description": "Relive the high school experience where you play as the girl with unlimited social leverage. Late 2000’s aesthetic with the most biting social accuracy in the history of media. Expect the unexpected. As you make your way to 15 different endings, our cast featuring Elsie Lovelock, Kayli Mills, Kira Buckland, and more will play you through the action the way it was meant to unfold!

Bonus lore and unlockable scenes upon 100%ing the game. Clothes change in real time, 100+ outfits to cover 25 characters. Momodora Moonlit Farewell",
