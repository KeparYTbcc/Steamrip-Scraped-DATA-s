    "description": "After letting his girlfriend down for the last time, Billy is swiftly dumped on his two-year anniversary. While moping home alone in the rain, a mysterious portal swallows Billy up and abandons him on a distant planet.\nHere, Billy will learn to become the dependable person he should have always been. Oh, and heâ€™ll also uncover an ancient alien prophecy and save the world, too. Lost But Found\nBilly Saves the World is a comedic , sci-fi love story that spans time and space, inspired by the whimsy of Monkey Island and Futurama. Written, directed, and designed by award-winning filmmaker, Cooper Bibaud.\nCHOOSE BETWEEN TWO DISTINCT GAMEPLAY STYLES: Progress through all five story chapters by leaning toward action-platforming OR slow things down seamlessly and use your head by leaning toward a puzzle- adventure game. Play how YOU prefer.",
