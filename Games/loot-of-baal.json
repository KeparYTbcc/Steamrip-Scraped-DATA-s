    "description": "We are deeply sorry. Less than 10 hours after our game went live, our servers were hit by an unidentified attack. We are urgently investigating the source and method of the attack. Unfortunately, some data has already been lost, and we are left with no choice but to temporarily shut down the online mode.\nIn the meantime, we kindly ask all players to use the local save mode to continue playing . Aside from trading features, the local mode is identical to the online mode in every way. We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this has caused and thank you for your understanding.\n“Loot of Baal” is an idle game nestled right on your screen’s sidebar. Multitask your way to glory by sending your hireling crew out to explore, fight demons, and collect loot while you focus on other things! With hundreds of uniquely skilled hirelings, over 1000 distinct items, and a wealth of randomized battle stages , there’s always something to discover. Craft items and upgrade them to Immortal levels, and trade items online with other players to create the perfect team of heroes. FBC: Firebreak\nAssemble your hireling crew from 5 distinctive classes—Mage, Paladin, Ranger, Berserker, and Necromancer—experiment with 72 unique skills, and gear up with over 400 Immortal items and 1000+ unique equipment pieces. Design creative combos to tackle diverse challenges—blast enemies with elemental magic , enchant weapons into mythical artifacts, or stack auras to bolster your team. Create your own unstoppable style\nThe loot system is rich with randomness , offering a treasure pool with thousands of different affixes. Each drop is a surprise, combining random traits from this pool to create one-of-a-kind items. From magic to legendary and all the way to epic items, every discovery is a step closer to perfection. And chasing those maxed-out stats? That’s an endless journey in itself!",
