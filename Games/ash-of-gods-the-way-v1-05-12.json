    "description": "Build winning decks of warriors , equipment, and spells from four different factions in this story-driven tactical card combat game. Battle your way through a series of major tournaments, each with their own opponents, battlefields, and even rules. TasteMaker\nEarn new cards and upgrade your favorites, then combine them into any number of decks : you’re free to experiment as much as you like Do prepare carefully for key battles with major characters: you’ll only get a few chances before defeat will change the course of the story, though the game continues\nYou play as Finn, a young man whose only hope of preventing a neighboring nation from attacking his home is to master the card game they use to teach aristocrats the art of warfare: the Way. Infiltrate the tournaments they hold, and you can get close to their elite commanders. What you do once you get there will be up to you. Just remember, your decisions have consequences\nThe core gameplay is deceptively simple: every turn you can play one warrior, and one support card, then all your units will advance towards the enemy and attack if they can But the challenge comes in what combinations you choose, how you build your deck, and when you hold back cards for a better opportunity. Your opponents play by the same rules most of the time. Each battle can have different rules or special features that can be exploited by smart deck building",
