    "description": "Neon lights, palm trees, synthwave, ’80s supercars speeding down an endless highway… Welcome to the world of Retrowave Listening to Synthwave / Retrowave most people have had this feeling of nostalgia for an era they didn’t know or that never existed. The Retrowave is very much inspired by the ’80s, but is mostly an idealized futuristic version of the ’80s. This game offers the player the unique experience of being immersed in this wonderful world for at least a few moments Car games.\nIn Retrowave you will first start with one car, then you will be able to upgrade it or buy other cars with the money earned at the end of each run. Race your car through different unique worlds Watch out for other vehicles on the road (yes, even in the future there will be traffic). Retrowave offers above all a visual and sound experience that will delight fans of the genre and will surely make those who don’t know it yet discover this wonderful universe",
