    "description": "If you scream , you restart. DON’T SCREAM is an Unreal Engine 5 short horror experience inspired by ’90s camcorder found footage. Made by two indie devs. The challenge is simple: explore the mysterious Pineview Forest for 18 minutes without screaming. OPERATOR\nSounds easy, right? But there’s a catch. Time only progresses as you move, and you cannot predict the scares. You must calibrate your microphone in-game so that every whimper , jump, or even a minor squeak is registered as a scream, increasing the challenge. With dozens of dynamic scares, each playthrough offers a unique experience.\nIt’s the perfect game to scare the pants off your friends and family . Our lead playtester (also my wife) is currently in a clinic recovering.",
