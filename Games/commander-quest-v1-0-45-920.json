    "description": "Commander Quest is a one-of-a-kind roguelike born from a genre combination of deck-building card games and real-time strategy. Experience unique and deep gameplay where you strategize unit synergies and watch the results unfold on the battlefield with cute but brutal fantasy units. Cheaters Cheetah\n“Various Races and Commanders” You will become various historical heroes leading your army, exploring a cute but brutal fantasy world. Imbue the soul of your chosen hero into the bodies of different races and embark on your expedition. Through the combination of deck- building roguelike and auto-battle RTS, experience exciting battles with diverse synergies and unit affinities.\n“Deck Building” To navigate this uniquely charming world, you’ll need to grow your deck through various experiences as you progress. Victory in battle rewards you with gold for use in shops and events, food for strength in emergencies, and card rewards. Trade at the mobile shop run by goblin merchants for your commanders, collecting the best synergy cards to prepare for the next battle.\nAs you progress, you may encounter intriguing events like meeting environmental groups trying to protect rat swarms or goblin salesmen offering savings plans. Choose the most helpful options from these events to grow further, but don’t forget—things can go wrong\n“Dangerous Battles” In each battle, you can summon units by placing cards on the summon tiles. Unlike other card games, these units come to life on the battlefield, automatically engaging enemy units! Once you end your turn, the summoned units move according to their roles and effects, meeting and fighting the enemy. Every unit and battlefield considers various tactical elements, including the basics of anvil and hammer, flanking, and more. Analyze the patterns of encountered enemies and make the best choices using the cards available each turn.",
