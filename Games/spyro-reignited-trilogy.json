    "description": "Get Spyro Reignited Trilogy for free instantly and play pre-installed on SteamRiP\nThe original roast master is back! Same sick burns, same smoldering attitude, now all scaled up in stunning HD. Spyro is bringing the heat like never before in the Spyro Reignited Trilogy game collection. Rekindle the fire with the original three games, Spyro the Dragon, Spyro 2: Ripto’s Rage and Spyro: Year of the Dragon. Explore the expansive realms, re-encounter the fiery personalities and relive the adventure in fully remastered glory. Because when there’s a realm that needs saving, there’s only one dragon to call. Sands of Salzaar If you’re still stumped, we have an Easy to Miss Gems section to help you locate the more devious Gems . In addition to the above tip, the most common way of missing Gems in Reignited is not even seeing them due to the long grass.\nThis particularly affects players of the original game who are used to hoovering up every Gem in sight without needing to search for them. To that end, make sure to search through the long grass, even in caves which sometimes feature dry brown grass. The Minimap is a neat little feature originally exclusive to Spyro 2, but has now been expanded to all three games in Reignited and can be activated in the Pause Menu. Using it, you can get a quick layout of the level, which can be handy if you’re missing a bunch of collectibles and need to find a place in the level you haven’t been to yet. If you’re playing Spyro 2, the level exit will always be marked with a Red Dot, while any Orb Challenges you find will be marked with a Green Dot.",
