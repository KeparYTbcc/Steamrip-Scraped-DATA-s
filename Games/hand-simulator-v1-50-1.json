    "description": "Hand Simulator is a game in which you control your own hands (You do not need a VR helmet, you just need a keyboard and mouse). There are many different levels where you can play with spinners, plunge into the subtleties of handling weapons, milk a cow, take part in a Mexican duel with your friends, have a good time fishing, play chess or simply chat in an anonymous club. Hand Simulator is a game where everyone finds entertainment for their tastes.",
