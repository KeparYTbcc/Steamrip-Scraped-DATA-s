    "description": "You’re a car with legs! Race through hundreds of unique levels: jump, fly with jetpacks , climb tall buildings, deliver packages, and do pretty much everything you can’t do in a normal racing game.\nBE A CAR AND EXPLORE THE WORLD\nIt’s not all about the need for speed. Explore the many islands to meet new friends, find hidden treasures or solve quirky puzzles. Hint: Look behind the waterfalls I Am Your Beast\nLOADS OF WAYS TO RACE\nYou will be racing, but it’s never what you expect. Hint: Just go with the flow\nOKAY, IT GETS REALLY SILLY\nYou’ll be flipping burgers, fishing, swimming, and singing CAR-aoke Hint: Don’t talk to the laser cow\nCREATE YOUR OWN LEVELS Make your own wacky levels, share them with friends and family, or climb the leaderboards of quirky levels made by other players. Hint: Adding cute bears and speed pads that go vroom works every time",
