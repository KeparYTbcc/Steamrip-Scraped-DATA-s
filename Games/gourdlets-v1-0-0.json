    "description": "Choo choo! The train is pulling into the station , bringing the very first batch of gourdlet citizens to their new island home. Your job is to build them a perfect town.\nBut don’t worry – Gourdlets are super laid back, and they’ll be happy no matter what you build. The only real challenge is pleasing yourself Sins of a Solar Empire II\nFrom cafes to lighthouses, planters to fountains, there’s a huge catalogue of decorations to play with. You can even go inside buildings and arrange the furniture how you like.\nThe gourdlets will make themselves at home in your town, fishing, reading, camping, snoozing, and generally having a grand old time. Craft the perfect veggie town in Gourdlets You can choose to play in full screen, or in “idle window mode” to let your gourdlets hang out at the bottom of your screen while you get on with other things on your PC.",
