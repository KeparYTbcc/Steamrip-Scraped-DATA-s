A massive, open world full of wonder and peril awaits you You have crash-landed on an alien ocean world, and the only way to go is down. Subnauticaâ€™s oceans range from sun drenched shallow coral reefs to treacherous deep-sea trenches, lava fields, and bio- luminescent underwater rivers. NFS\nManage your oxygen supply as you explore kelp forests, plateaus, reefs, and winding cave systems. The water teems with life: Some of it helpful, much of it harmful. After crash landing in your Life Pod, the clock is ticking to find water, food, and to develop the equipment you need to explore. Collect resources from the ocean around you. Craft diving gear, lights, habitat modules, and submersibles. Venture deeper and further form to find rarer resources, allowing you to craft more advanced items.",
