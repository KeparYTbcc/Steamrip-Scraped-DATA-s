    "description": "Welcome to HAAK, a world brimming with contraptions and dangers . Dangerous mutants walk the land while dark forces move in the shadows. The game takes place in a world ravaged by disaster. The once glorious city has been reduced to ruins, and the survivors struggle for survival . In the south, a land called Sanho has mostly remained unaffected by the calamity due to its unique geographical environment and has grown into something of a sanctuary. Way of the Hunter\nThe protagonist , Haak, is a traveler from a small northern town. He chose to leave his home and ventured south to survive. Haak is an explorative game combining action-platformer gameplay with Metroidvania. Traverse the land with your hook, dash, and charged slash. Fully hand-drawn graphics with unique and interesting characters . A retro & futuristic pixel world for a comic-esque feel.",
