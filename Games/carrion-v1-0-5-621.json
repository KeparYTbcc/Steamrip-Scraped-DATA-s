The huge complex and its inhabitants turn into a bloody mess in literally the first few minutes, but this is only the very beginning. The creature controlled by the player is capable of evolving . To obtain improvements, it must break glass containers similar to the one from which it appeared: after that, the demon will receive skills that will help him get through previously inaccessible places. CARRION is a reverse horror game in which you assume the role of an amorphous creature of unknown origin. Stalk and consume those that imprisoned you to spread fear and panic throughout the facility. Grow and evolve as you tear down this prison and acquire more and more devastating abilities on the path to retribution .",
