    "description": "You wake up in your room, feeling disoriented , with no recollection of anything. In the midst of your confusion, you come across a person you don’t recognize. Who is she, and why is she in your home? But the central question lingers: why can’t you remember anything? To find answers, you realize you must converse with that stranger. The decision of whether to trust her or remain cautious now lies in your hands Disco Simulator\nOver time, more screenshots and a gameplay trailer will be added. I will continually update and provide all necessary information, ensuring you don’t miss anything.",
