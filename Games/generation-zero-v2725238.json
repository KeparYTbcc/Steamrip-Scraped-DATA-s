    "description": "Where did the robots come from? What do they want? How can you survive ? Generation Zero is a stealth-action hybrid with a rich and rewarding world to explore and mysteries to uncover. Play alone or with up to three friends in a vast open-world map that will challenge your resourcefulness and ingenuity. Because living is winning. Hide, seek, scavenge and shoot your way through a world of peril and secrets.\nFrom dense forests to derelict towns, from vast fields to bbases, Östertörn is a location with a story to tell where no two encounters are the same. As you journey through Östertörn you will connect with other survivors, each with their own unique story to tell. When enough of you have banded together, a resistance can begin to rise.",
