    "description": "Junkyard Truck is an open-world off road driving, mechanic simulator, and job simulator. Start by buying an old truck from the junkyard. You’ll need to replace some worn out or missing parts, and then put it back together and hope you did a thorough job. Once you get it running, you can use your truck to complete off road missions and jobs to earn some money. When the missions get too tough, visit the auto parts store to buy better engine parts, wheels, drivetrain parts, or accessories or you might have to scavenge the junkyard if you’re low on funds.\nJobs and missions pay well, but you’ll need to use that money to maintain your truck. When you think your truck is powerful enough, and you have enough bankroll for major repairs, use your truck to complete some of the map’s challenges, such as races, rock crawls, hill climbs, and very destructive long jumps. If you’re not good with mechanics, don’t worry. Your truck comes with a fully illustrated service manual. The town also has a mechanic who can give inspections, or even make repairs if you have the cash. Democracy 4",
